            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:64024:3"/>themſelves to work it out, and to attain unto it. But the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is directly <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite</hi> unto this <hi>humour</hi> of <hi>corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> the whole ſcope and deſign of it being to ſhew, that both mans <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> lies <hi>perfectly</hi> out of himſelf:<note place="margin">Iſa. 45.24.

               <hi>We are not ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves, but our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency is of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>principal thing</hi> intended in theſe <hi>Sermons</hi> is to <hi>commend</hi> the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and to ſet forth the <hi>excellency</hi> and <hi>neceſſity</hi> of it; and what is treated of in the former Part of the Book is <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory</hi> and <hi>leading</hi> thereunto.</p>
            <p>And this I may ſay, That what I have Preached, and is here repreſented in theſe <hi>Sermons,</hi> I have had <hi>experience</hi> of the Truth of, throughout the greateſt part of my life; eſpecially in <hi>ſeveral ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> and <hi>many infirmities,</hi> with which the moſt <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>holy God</hi> hath pleaſed to exerciſe me in the courſe of my Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. For what ever we may ſuppoſe our own <hi>ſtrength, ability,</hi> and <hi>attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to be, when we come to be under
<pb facs="tcp:64024:4"/>

When the hand of God is upon us in any <hi>ſpecial Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> then ſhall we find that we cannot fetch in that comfort from former expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, as we would think we might eaſily do, nor <hi>ſupport</hi> our ſelves under ſuch a Tryal, nor put forth any one Act of Faith or obedience, <hi>without new ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies</hi> of <hi>preſent actual</hi> Grace. And thus doth <hi>Chriſts ſtrength</hi> come to be <hi>perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> in our <hi>infirmity.</hi>

               <p>IN this whole <hi>context</hi> we have four things obſervable:</p>
               <p n="1">1. We have <hi>Pauls exerciſe, the Temptation and Conflict</hi> that he was under; <hi>there was given unto me a thorn in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to buffet me.</hi> Theſe words deſcribe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64024:6"/>unto us the <hi>exerciſe</hi> or <hi>conflict</hi> that the Holy Apoſtle was under.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing remarkable in the words is this, We have the <hi>ground</hi> and <hi>occaſion</hi> of this <hi>exerciſe</hi> and <hi>conflict</hi> of his, and that was the danger that he was in of being lifted up, <hi>leſt I ſhould be exalted through the abundance of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, there was given unto me a thorn in the fleſh, a meſſenger of Satan to buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. We have <hi>Pauls carriage</hi> under this temptation, and the courſe he took when he was tempted, at the eighth verſe, <hi>For this thing I beſought the Lord thrice that it might depart from me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly and Laſtly, We have the gracious anſwer that he had to his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at the ninth verſe. <hi>And he ſaid unto me, My grace is ſufficient for thee, for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are ſeveral Obſervations that do naturally ariſe out of the Text.</p>
               <p>The firſt Obſervation or Doctrine is this,</p>
               <p>That it is the lot of the holyeſt men,<note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> and of the moſt eminent ſervants of God, to be exerciſed with grievous and ſore temptations; <hi>there was given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64024:6"/>to me a thorn in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Satan to buffet me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Obſervation that ariſeth out of the words is this,</p>
               <p>That <hi>men of the higheſt grace,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>of the greateſt holineſs, are yet in danger of Spiritual Pride, and of being lifted up above meaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leſt I ſhould be exalted above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>there was given unto me a thorn in the fleſh, a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Satan to buffet me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> was an Apoſtle, a man of more than ordinary grace, and yet he was in danger of ſpiritual Pride; leſt <hi>I,</hi> ſhould be exalted above meaſure, there was given to <hi>me</hi> a thorn in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Satan to buffet me.</p>
               <p>The third Obſervation that ariſeth out of the Text is this,</p>
               <p>That <hi>the principal end why God permits it, and orders it to be ſo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>that his people ſhould be tempted and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go ſore conflicts, it is to keep them from being lifted up.</hi> Leſt I ſhould be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above meaſure, there was <hi>given</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me a thorn in the fleſh, a meſſenger of Satan to buffet me.</p>
               <p>It is obſervable that the end of this exerciſe of <hi>Paul</hi> is repeated twice:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64024:7"/>in the beginning of the verſe, <hi>leſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure,</hi> ſo in the end of the verſe, <hi>leſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure;</hi> I ſay this is twice repeated, intimating thus much, that the principal end that God aimed at in this diſpenſation of his towards <hi>Paul,</hi> it was to keep him humble and ſuppreſs Spiritual Pride in him.</p>
               <p>The fourth Obſervation or Doctrine that is contained in the words is this,</p>
               <p>That the proper courſe that is to be taken when we are under temptation,<note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> is to pray much. <hi>For this thing I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the Lord thrice;</hi> I beſought the Lord <hi>thrice,</hi> that is often, a certain number for an uncertain; <hi>thrice,</hi> that is many times.</p>
               <p>The fifth Obſervation that ariſeth out of the Text is this,</p>
               <p>That praying ſouls ſhall have a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of grace to carry them through all their trials,<note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> conflicts and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>And he ſaid, My grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt Obſervation contained in the words is this,</p>
               <p>That Gods ſtrength is made perfect in our weakneſs,<note place="margin">Obſerv. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:64024:7"/>
               <p>All theſe Obſervations are points of great moment. I ſhall begin to ſpeak of the firſt of theſe Doctrines, and that is this,</p>
               <p>Doct. 1.<note place="margin">Doct. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>That it is the lot of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt men, and of the moſt eminent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God to be exerciſed with grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and ſore temptations.</hi> This I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from thoſe words, <hi>there was given to me a thorn in the fleſh, a meſſenger of Satan to buffet me.</hi> There was given to me a thorn in the fleſh. It is much controverted by Interpreters, what this <hi>thorn in the fleſh</hi> ſhould be, and they have ſeveral conjectures about it, ſome conceive it to be one thing, ſome ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I ſhall not trouble you with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral opinions and conjectures about it, I rather incline to what <hi>Calvin</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives to be the meaning of theſe words.<note place="margin">Ego ſub hoc vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabulo compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendi arbitror o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                  </note> He conceives by this <hi>thorn in the fleſh</hi> is not meant ſo much one particular temptation, as temptations of all ſorts and kinds; it was not one or two, or a few temptations only that <hi>Paul</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed with, but he was exerciſed with variety of temptations, with all ſorts and kinds of temptations; and by the <hi>fleſh, Calvin</hi> underſtands not the <hi>body,</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:64024:8"/>but the <hi>unregenerate part</hi> in <hi>Paul, Paul</hi> himſelf had an <hi>unregenerate part</hi> in him, as well as a <hi>regenerate,</hi> and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of that unregenrate part in him, he was ſtill ſubject to temptations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf had not attained to that <hi>ſpirituality,</hi> but he had ſo much of the <hi>unregenerate part</hi> in him that did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him to temptations. This <hi>thorn in the fleſh</hi> is called <hi>the meſſenger of Satan,</hi> there was given to me <hi>a thorn in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Satan</hi> to buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet me. Why the meſſenger of Satan? The reaſon is, becauſe as temptations are injected by Satan, ſo when ever a temptation ariſeth, it ſhould put us in remembrance who it is that we have to deal with.</p>
               <p>When ever a temptation comes, we ought to remember that Satan is near at hand, he is the author of the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he is the enemy that we have to deal withal; and we ſhould not be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure having ſuch a ſubtil and malicious enemy to deal with.</p>
               <p>Now this meſſenger of Satan it was ſent to buffet <hi>Paul,</hi> there was given to me a thorn in the fleſh, a meſſenger of Satan <hi>to buffet me.</hi>

                     </gap>. Phavo inus.</note> the greek word ſignifies to beat another with the <hi>fiſt:</hi> now you know that is an Ignominious thing; when a perſon is beaten with the fiſt <hi>black</hi> and <hi>blew,</hi> when his face is marr'd, it is a ſhameful reproachful thing, when a mans face is buffeted and his viſage marred by it, he is aſhamed to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to company, it ſtrikes ſhame into him. So <hi>Pauls</hi> temptations ſtruck him into a <hi>holy ſhame,</hi> his temptations were a means to fill him with a ſenſe of his own <hi>infirmities,</hi> and take down all high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of himſelf, to ſhew him what he was in caſe he were left to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Now if ſuch a man as <hi>Paul</hi> was, a man of his grace and experience, no leſs than an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> if he were exerciſed with theſe temptations, then we ſee it is the lot of the moſt eminent ſervants of God to be exerciſed with moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and ſore temptations.</p>
               <p>For the handling this <hi>point,</hi> there are three things to be ſpoken unto in the Doctrinal part.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. I ſhall ſhew what Temptation is, open a little the nature of <hi>Temptation.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Shew you what the ſeveral <hi>ſorts</hi> and <hi>kinds</hi> of <hi>Temptation</hi> are.</item>
               </list>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:64024:9"/>
               <p>And then thirdly, We ſhall come to the <hi>Grounds and Reaſons</hi> of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, why it is that God trains up his Children under this <hi>diſcipline,</hi> why it is that he ſuffers them to be exerciſed under grievous and ſore Temptations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſhall open the nature of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; what is Temptation?</p>
               <p>For the nature of it in General you may take it thus;<note place="margin">The Nature of Temptation.</note> Temptation it is that <hi>proof or experiment that is taken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a perſon for the diſcovery of mans weakneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Illuſtration of Gods power.</hi> This is the <hi>Definition</hi> of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.</p>
               <p>The nature of Temptation may be known by the conſideration of the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> and <hi>final</hi> cauſe of it, the <hi>formal</hi> cauſe of Temptation is the <hi>experiment</hi> or <hi>proof</hi> that is taken concerning a perſon.</p>
               <p>To <hi>tempt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tentare, eſt probare, ſive experimentum ſumere de ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo.</note> it is to <hi>prove</hi> or take an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment</hi> concerning another; to tempt, it is to put things to the <hi>trial,</hi> to make things <hi>evident</hi> concerning a perſon, how things ſtand with him. Now the end of Temptation being to <hi>make known</hi> ſomething that was not made known before, we muſt underſtand this aright.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:64024:9"/>
               <p>That which is made known by Temptation, it is not any thing to God, for God knows all things from eternity, <hi>he knew what was in man,</hi> John 2.25. But that which is made known by Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, it is ſomething to our <hi>ſelves</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> ſomething by Temptation is made known to our ſelves and others that was not known before; and this is the Nature of Temptation to diſcover ſomething to our ſelves and others that was not ſo clearly known and underſtood before. And Temptations give us an <hi>experimental knowledge</hi> of a thing; that which we knew only <hi>conjecturally</hi> and <hi>opinionatively</hi> before, when we come to be Tempted we have an <hi>experimental knowledge</hi> of that thing. And hence it is that the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> diſtinguiſh between that knowledge which is acquired by <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>diſcourſe,</hi> and that which is gotten by <hi>experience.</hi> We may know many things by reaſon and diſcourſe; now it is one thing to know things by reaſon and diſcourſe, and another thing to know things <hi>experimentally,</hi> an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental</hi> knowledge is the moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge of things: Now this is the formal cauſe of Temptation, that it is the <hi>experiment</hi> or <hi>proof</hi> which is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64024:10"/>concerning a perſon. As for the <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> cauſe of Temptation, that is two fold.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The <hi>diſcovery</hi> of mans <hi>weakneſs,</hi> or <hi>infirmity.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. The <hi>Illuſtration</hi> of <hi>Divine</hi> Power.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. One great end of Temptation is, the <hi>diſcovery</hi> of our own <hi>infirmity;</hi> we never come to know what we are, till we come to be under Temptation; we think our ſtrength is greater than it is till we come to be tempted, we think we can do more than we can do, we think we can maſter ſuch a difficulty, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch a corruption, perform ſuch a duty, withſtand ſuch an allurement; but when a Temptation comes, then our weakneſs and infirmity is ſoon ſeen. Now this is one end of Temptation to diſcover to man his weakneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity.</p>
               <p>Thus we find how the Lord led his people through the wilderneſs to <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> them and <hi>prove</hi> them, Deut. 8.16. <hi>Who fed thee in the wilderneſs with Manna, which thy Fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end.</hi> And ſo in the third verſe of that Chapter, and verſe 2. <hi>And thou ſhalt remember all the way
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64024:10"/>which the Lord thy God led thee theſe fourty years in the Wilderneſs, to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus God proved <hi>Hezekiah</hi> that he might know what was in his heart, 2 Chron 32.31. <hi>Howbeit, in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the embaſſadors of the Princes of Babylon, who ſent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The meaning is, that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> might know what was in his own heart; God knew what was in his heart before, but God left him under this Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that he might know all that was in his own heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other end of Temptation is the <hi>Illuſtration</hi> of Divine Power. God therefore ſuffers us to be under Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, that he might manifeſt his power in ſupporting us under Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; this is expreſt a little after the text, <hi>my ſtrength is perfected in infirmity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By Temptations we have experience of our own <hi>weakneſs,</hi> and of <hi>Divine Power;</hi> when a Temptation comes, then we find we have no ability in our ſelves to withſtand it (though before the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64024:11"/>Temptation came we thought we were ſtrong enough) and then God puts forth his power to inable us to do what we could not do of our ſelves, and ſo Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power is Illuſtrated.</p>
               <p>After God hath ſhewn us what we cannot do of our ſelves, then he ſhews us what his Divine Grace can inable us to do: hence is that expreſſion that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the text, <hi>moſt gladly will I glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in my infirmities, that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>ſenſe</hi> of our infirmity makes way for the manifeſtation of Divine Power. When God hath ſhewn us by Temptation what we cannot do, then he ſhews us what his grace can do in us and for us; and this is the nature of Temptation. Temptation it is the proof or experiment that is taken concerning a perſon for the maniſeſtation of his weakneſs and Illuſtration of Divine power.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to be ſpoken unto is, to ſhew what are the ſeveral ſorts or kinds of Temptation.</p>
               <p>There are four <hi>ſorts</hi> or <hi>kinds</hi> of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation that we may diſtinguiſh of.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Some that we may call <hi>Divine</hi> Temptations.</item>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:64024:11"/>
                  <item>2. <hi>Carnal</hi> or <hi>Fleſhly</hi> Temptations.</item>
                  <item>3. There are <hi>worldly</hi> Temptations.</item>
                  <item>4. and Laſtly, there are <hi>Satanical</hi> Temptations.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. There are ſome which are called <hi>Divine Temptations,</hi> ſuch as proceed immediately from God himſelf, Gen. 22.1. <hi>After theſe things God did tempt Abraham;</hi> here you ſee there was a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Temptation:</hi> now theſe Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that we call <hi>Divine Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and do proceed from God, are not to be underſtood ſo as if God did tempt to ſin, <hi>God cannot be tempted with evil, neither doth he tempt any man,</hi> that is, he doth not tempt any man to <hi>ſin, Jam.</hi> 1.13. Theſe Temptations therefore that we call Divine Temptations, are nothing elſe but thoſe trials which God brings upon his Children for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their graces. When God brings his people into ſome notable ſtreight, or difficulty, or affliction, that they know not which way to turn or wind themſelves out of it, this is that which is properly called a Divine Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and theſe trials are therefore call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Temptations,</hi> becauſe by theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations God tries his people what they are, and what their ſtrength, or

               <p n="2">2. There are <hi>carnal</hi> or <hi>fleſhly</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations. Now thoſe Temptations that we call carnal or fleſhly Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they are ſuch Temptations that ariſe out of mans own heart, Jam. 1.14. <hi>Every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own luſts and enticed. Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſin,</hi> that is, that pravity and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of nature that is in us, is here called by the name of <hi>luſt:</hi> now this pravity of nature, this draweth us away and <hi>enticeth</hi> us, there is that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature in us, which as it is in its ſelf a ſin, ſo it is a Temptation to ſin. Corrupt nature provokes and ſollicits us to ſin: <hi>In me, that is, in my fleſh there dwells no good thing.</hi> In the <hi>fleſh,</hi> that is in <hi>corrupt</hi> nature, there is no <hi>good</hi> thing, nay in the fleſh dwells eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>evil</hi> thing, <hi>I find a Law in my mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, warring againſt the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of ſen which is in my mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> Rom. 7.23.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:64024:13"/>
               <p>Now this is that we underſtand by fleſhly Temptations, namely, the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations that are in our hearts to ſin.</p>
               <p>Original Sin conſiſts of theſe two parts.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Of that indiſpoſition and averſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is in us to good.</item>
                  <item>2. Of that propenſion or proneneſs that is in us unto evil.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now there is an <hi>habitual inclination,</hi> and an <hi>actual inclination</hi> unto evil; and that <hi>actual inclination</hi> in us unto evil, it is the budding of Original Sin; it is the exerting or putting forth of that <hi>habitual inclination</hi> that is in us. Now the exerting and putting forth of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin in actual inclinations, this is that which is properly called fleſhly or carnal Temptations. The Schoolmen call this the <hi>impulſe of ſenſuality,</hi> they alſo call it the <hi>firſt motions</hi> that ariſe in the heart tending to ſin.</p>
               <p>It is a good expreſſion of <hi>Auſtin,</hi>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64024:14"/>
                  <hi>Temptations,</hi> becauſe theſe firſt inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have an alluring quality, a prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in them, to draw men to ſin in act. Corrupt nature is apt to gratifie it ſelf in its own deſires: and when corrupt nature diſcovers its inclination to a ſin, this is a ſtrong Temptation to every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate perſon, and he knows not how to reſiſt it. Hence is it ſaid of unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate men, that they <hi>fulfil the deſires of the fleſh and of the mind,</hi> Epheſ. 2.3. that is, that way that the fleſh would have them go they will go. When the fleſh is bending and inclining to ſuch a thing, that way they will bend and incline. And <hi>Regenerate perſons</hi> themſelves, though they have a contrary principle of grace that doth oppoſe, yet theſe corrupt riſings and inclinations that ariſe from Original ſin within them, are a great incentive to them, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they are aſſiſted by actual grace, they are many times overcome in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular acts.<note place="margin">Tentatio à car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne interius op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnans de no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtro contra nos roboratur.</note> 
                  <hi>That Temptation,</hi> ſaith one, <hi>that ariſeth from the fleſh within, is fortified and ſtrengthned by our ſelves againſt our ſelves,</hi> and therefore theſe fleſhly Temptations, theſe Temptations that ariſe from corrupt nature, that fountain of Original ſin which is in us,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64024:14"/>are the ſtrongeſt of all Temptations, and we are moſt apt to be overcome by them.</p>

               <p n="4">4. There are <hi>Satanical Temptations,</hi> and theſe Temptations are ſuch as come <hi>primarily</hi> and <hi>originally</hi> from <hi>Satan</hi> himſelf,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy-Ghoſt?</hi> Theſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64024:15"/>are <hi>Satanical Temptations,</hi> that come directly from <hi>Satan.</hi> Now theſe Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations that proceed from Satan, they are <hi>Infinite</hi> and <hi>Numberleſs.</hi> Satan hath <hi>various waies</hi> of tempting, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we read of the <hi>fiery darts</hi> of the Devil, ſometimes we read of his <hi>wiles,</hi> ſometimes we read of his <hi>devices,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we read how he <hi>transforms</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into an <hi>Angel of light.</hi> Satan hath many ways of <hi>aſſaulting</hi> the Saints, ſometimes he aſſaults them by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of <hi>Blaſphemous thoughts,</hi> and theſe are ſo terrible to ſome of the Saints that they are weary of their lives; ſometimes by the <hi>injection</hi> of <hi>impure thoughts,</hi> ſometimes he aſſaults them by <hi>cruel Temptations,</hi> tempting them to things that are againſt nature, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to nature, as to ſelf murder and the like; ſometimes he <hi>transforms him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> into an <hi>Angel</hi> of light, and <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits</hi> the voice of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and the beſt way to diſcover theſe Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, it is by comparing them with the word. Whatever Satans pretence is, his deſign is always to take us off from the word, and to reduce us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or practiſe ſomething that hath not a warrant in the word for it.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64024:16"/>Therefore we may take this for a rule.</p>
               <p>How plauſible ſoever the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, if it hath not a warrant from the word, it comes from Satan who transforms himſelf into an Angel of light.</p>
               <p>But Satans uſual and ordinary way of tempting is, by ſuiting his Temptations to our corrupt nature. Satan obſerves which way our corrupt nature bends, and inclines, and ſuits his Temptations accordingly.</p>
               <p>Thus have I now opened the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and have ſhewn what Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in general, and alſo the ſeveral ſorts and kinds of Temptation.</p>
               <p>The next thing that comes to be ſpoken unto is, the <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> of the point.</p>
               <p>Why God ſuffers his people to be thus exerciſed with grievous and ſore Temptations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One Reaſon lies in the text, it is to <hi>humble</hi> his people, <hi>leſt I ſhould be exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above meaſure through abundance of revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to buffet me.</hi> Temptation is the <hi>Phyſick</hi> or <hi>Medicine</hi> that God uſeth to keep his people from pride. How
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64024:16"/>great is the poyſon of pride,<note place="margin">O quantum eſt venerum ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biae quod non poteſt niſi vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no curari.</note> that can be cured by nothing elſe but poyſon? So great an enemie is God to pride, that he ſometimes lets his people fall into temptation, yea ſometimes into other ſins, to keep them from pride; but of this more in its proper place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another Reaſon why God ſuffers his people to be exerciſed by Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is to keep them from <hi>ſecurity;</hi> when temptations are abſent we are apt to be ſecure, and let fall our watch. Now God by letting looſe Temptations upon us, admoniſheth us of the danger we are in. We are little ſenſible of the danger we are in of being overtaken with ſuch and ſuch ſins. God ſuffers a Temptation to break in upon us, and then he lets us ſee, that unleſs we watch and pray, we may ſoon enter into Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God ſuffers us to be tempted to quicken our <hi>dependence</hi> upon himſelf, and to cauſe us to run to him. When we are free from Temptation, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume of our own ſtrength, and think all is well; God lets looſe a Temptation upon us, and then we ſee the need of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace to keep us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God ſuffers his people to be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64024:17"/>that they may be the better fitted to comfort others in their Temptations. It is ſaid of our Saviour,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.18.</note> 
                  <hi>That he being tempted, is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi> None ſo fit to comfort <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted ſouls,</hi> as he that hath been exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Temptations himſelf.</p>
               <p n="5">5. God exerciſeth his people with Temptations to prepare them for his <hi>Divine conſolations.</hi> When our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour underwent that great Temptation in the wilderneſs, the <hi>Angels came</hi> and <hi>miniſtred unto him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark 1.13.</note> It is the uſual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of God, firſt to humble, then to comfort. Now Temptations are a means to humble the Saints, and ſo to prepare them for Divine Conſolations. Experienced ſouls know this to be true, that the ſaints greateſt comforts come in after their greateſt conflicts. I have ſcarce known any, that have attained to great experience in Divine conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but thoſe that have been greatly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed and tried with Temptations.</p>
               <p n="6">6. God ſuffers his people to be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted that he may add to their <hi>Crown,</hi> Jam. 1.12. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth temptation: for when he is tried, he ſhall receive the Crown of life which the Lord hath promiſed to them that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64024:17"/>love him.</hi> We read of ſome in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth of <hi>Revelations, That they were cloathed with white robes, and they had palms in their hands:</hi> and who were theſe? theſe were ſuch as came out of great tribulation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14. The ſaints who came out of great tribulation and temptation, theſe are they that have palms of victory put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands. God will put a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al mark and badge of honour upon ſuch as have undergone greateſt ſervices, and born the greateſt conflicts.<note place="margin">Tentatus habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis praemium duplex, ubi non tentatus, prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium es habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus ſimplex.</note> It was a good expreſſion of one: When thou art tempted and doſt overcome the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thou ſhalt have a double reward; whereas if thou art not tempted, thou ſhalt have a ſingle reward.</p>
               <p>Is it ſo,<note place="margin">Uſe.</note> that the ſaints are exerciſed with great and ſore temptations? Is it the lot of the holieſt men, of the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſervants of God to be exerciſed with grievous and ſore temptations?</p>
               <p>This ſhould teach us not to be aweary of the <hi>ſpiritual conflict;</hi> the <hi>life</hi> of a Chriſtian here on earth is a <hi>life of Temptation.</hi> Temptations we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and therefore we ought to prepare for them, 1 Tim. 6.12. <hi>Fight the good fight of faith.</hi> A Chriſtians life is a <hi>fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64024:18"/>life.</hi> A Chriſtian is incompaſſed round with many enemies, and he muſt expect to fight his way through, to Heaven. I often think of the ſpeech of an Ancient, Wiſe and Experienced Chriſtian, a man that had walkt with God many years:</p>
               <p>O ſaith he, it is <hi>hard fighting till we get to Heaven.</hi> We think of an <hi>eaſie Chriſtianity,</hi> we think to get <hi>ſmoothly</hi> to Heaven, we think to meet with no <hi>rubbs,</hi> difficulties, and temptations in our way, Oh but it will not be ſo! <hi>Through much tribulation we muſt enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> He that will be a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nos ſic ſumus, ut optemus ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum vilae &amp; laetitiae habere: ſed tentationes mortis &amp; triſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae abeſſe: bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li profectè &amp; ſuaves Tecologi!

                  </note> ſaith another, muſt expect to be converſant in the midſt of death, in the gripes and terrors of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, in the midſt of the teeth of the Devil and of Hell.</p>
               <p>There are temptations of divers ſorts and kinds, <hi>External, Internal. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations</hi> from the <hi>world,</hi> from <hi>Satan,</hi> from our <hi>own hearts:</hi> when one Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation is over we muſt expect another. There is no reſt or quiet for a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64024:18"/>to be expected on this ſide Heaven. It is true, God out of his infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodneſs gives ſome few inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of reſt and peace to his people, that they may not be quite worried by their temptations. But when they have reſted a while, they muſt expect new conflicts, new aſſaults. Thus we read of our Saviour when the Devil had <hi>ended his Temptations, he departed from him for a ſeaſon,</hi> Luke 4.13. The Devil had not ſo <hi>ended</hi> his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but he had a mind to <hi>begin</hi> again, and though he had left him for a <hi>ſeaſon,</hi> it was but for a ſeaſon, and it was to try him with freſh aſſaults. We muſt look for new aſſaults of the enemy. <hi>To him that overcometh will I grant to ſit with me in my throne, even as I alſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, and am ſet down with my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his throne,</hi> Revel. 3.21. We muſt firſt <hi>overcome</hi> before we can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the <hi>Crown.</hi> Now there muſt be a <hi>fighting</hi> before there can be an <hi>overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> No man can expect the reward till he have gotten the victory, and no victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry can be gotten without fighting.</p>
               <p>Our Life in this our Pilgrimage can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without temptations, becauſe our proficiency in grace is known by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64024:19"/>No man knows himſelf but by temptations. It is a ſpeech of <hi>Auſtin, No man can be crowned unleſs he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and no man can overcome unleſs he war and fight, neither can he war and fight unleſs he have enemies and temptations.</hi> Wherefore we ſhould not be weary of <hi>fighting,</hi> weary of ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, ſince this is the condition of our preſent ſtate. Our preſent ſtate is a <hi>warring conflicting</hi> ſtate. And by how much the more fiercely we are tempted and aſſaulted, by ſo much the more gloriouſly ſhall we be Crowned at laſt, if ſo be we overcome.</p>

If we would keep up this <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al conflict, Let us ſtudy and conſider which way our temptation lies,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>pride,</hi> or to <hi>paſſion,</hi> or to <hi>love</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> or to <hi>unbelief,</hi> or to ſome other thing: It is one great piece of a Chriſtians skill, to know which way his corruptions and temptations lie moſt.</p>
               <p>For unleſs we know wherein our <hi>weakneſs,</hi> and our <hi>enemies ſtrength</hi> lies moſt, how can we watch, or <hi>arm</hi> and <hi>fortifie</hi> our ſelves againſt them? Some have their temptations lying more <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,</hi> ſome more <hi>inwardly;</hi> ſome are more affected with <hi>outward</hi> things, with <hi>ſenſible</hi> things, with <hi>riches, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, ſenſual delights,</hi> and the like. Some have their temptations more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and are affected with envy; pride,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64024:20"/>unbelief, diffidence, diſtruſt of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God. Theſe are their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations. Now it concerns us wiſely to conſider where the ſtrength of our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations lies, for uſually every man hath ſome <hi>peculiar Temptation;</hi> ſomething or other that is more than other a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we would keep up the <hi>ſpiritual conflict,</hi> let us <hi>be ſure to oppoſe our watch and the utmoſt of our diligence there where the ſtrength of our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations lies.</hi> As he ſaid in that caſe, <hi>Fight not againſt great or ſmall, but againſt the King of Iſrael:</hi> So we ſhould ſet the main ſtrength of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle againſt our peculiar temptations, we ſhould fight againſt conſtitution ſins and corruptions. <hi>I was upright,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 18.23.</note> ſaith <hi>David, and kept my ſelf from my ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> He ſet himſelf againſt <hi>every ſin,</hi> but eſpecially he ſet himſelf to keep himſelf from <hi>his own iniquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. If we would keep up the <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al conflict let us be ſure not to go forth to fight and conflict with temptations in our own ſtrength.</hi> By ſtrength ſhall no man prevail, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.9. That is, no man ever did or ſhall prevail by his own ſtrength. We think to do great
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64024:21"/>things by the ſtrength of our reſolution, and truly reſolution is good if it be ſubordinate to our dependance on Chriſt. But if when we have had experience that ſuch a temptation hath been ſtrong upon us, and we think we will fortifie our reſolutions againſt it, and we ſhall bear it down another time by our own ſtrength; truly when temptation comes we ſhall feel our own weakneſs and fall very ſhamefully. I remember a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble expreſſion <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath, <hi>Why doſt thou ſtand in thy ſelf, and yet art not able to ſtand? caſt thy ſelf ſecurely on God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Quid in te ſtas, &amp; non ſtas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>fear not that God will fail thee, or ſuffer thee to fall to the ground, he will receive and heal thee.</hi> The beſt way in all temptations is to caſt our ſelves on Divine grace: wo to him that thinks to ſtand by himſelf.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If we would keep up the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al conflict, let us <hi>keep the eye of the mind fixt and intent upon God: Mine eyes are ever towards thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>David</hi> in the twenty ſeventh Pſalm. The beſt way to overcome our tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is to have our minds <hi>elevated</hi> and lifted up to God. Whilſt the mind hath a clear apprehenſion of God, and the affections carried out in ſtrength af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64024:21"/>God, it is not poſſible that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations ſhould prevail. I remember the reaſon the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> give of the <hi>confirmation</hi> of grace in the Saints in Heaven, and that they cannot fall; it is the <hi>beatifical viſion,</hi> becauſe they always ſee the face of God. The Saints in Heaven having always the ſight of God, <hi>adhere</hi> to him inſeparably; they having the ſight of God, and knowing that they have the fruition of the chief good, that there is not a better nor high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er good to be injoyed, nothing can be a temptation to them to draw them off from ſuch a good. We ſhould labour for a <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>more perfect knowledge</hi> of God here on earth; the more we know God <hi>experimentally,</hi> the leſs power will temptations have over us. If we have <hi>taſted</hi> that the Lord is <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi> if we have had but a little glimpſe of the Divine <hi>Excellency</hi> and <hi>perfection,</hi> all that the fleſh, and the Devil, and the world can offer to us, will ſeem little to what we ſee, and find to be in God. Therefore let us labour to have our mind and affections elevated to God: the morewe have our minds and affections elevated to God, the leſs will temptations prevail over us.</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:64024:22"/>
               <p>The ſecond <hi>Uſe</hi> is this;<note place="margin">Uſe <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> Is it ſo, that it is the lot of the <hi>holieſt</hi> men, and of the moſt <hi>eminent ſervants</hi> of God to be <hi>exerciſed</hi> with <hi>grievous</hi> and <hi>ſore temptations?</hi> This may <hi>inform</hi> us how much <hi>carnal people</hi> are miſtaken, who think their conditions to be therefore good, becauſe they meet with no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations. This is a great miſtake, they know not what <hi>conflicts</hi> and <hi>temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> mean. All things are quiet and in peace with them. They think they are a company of melancholy timorous people only, that ſpeak of inward troubles, and are vexed and diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with temptations. But ſuch tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations are never the leſs, becauſe they are not ſenſible of them. The greateſt temptation of all other is, to have no ſenſe of temptation. To this end let me propound to you theſe two Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When men are without <hi>ſenſe</hi> of temptations, it is a ſign they are <hi>taken captive by the Devil at his will.</hi> It is the expreſſion of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. When the <hi>ſtrong man armed keeps the houſe, all things are in peace.</hi> It is a ſign men are faſt bound in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans chains,</hi> when they are not ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64024:22"/>of his temptations. It is certain, that Satan is always reſtleſs in his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, ſtill laying ſnares and baits to tempt men to ſin, and the world is full of baits and ſnares; therefore when men think that they are moſt ſecure they are moſt in danger. Satans tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations are always neareſt to a man, when he thinks them fartheſt off.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When men have no <hi>ſenſe</hi> of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, it is a ſign they are deſtitute of a <hi>principle</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> that ſhould op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe temptation. It is ſaid of a Godly man, that he doth <hi>not commit ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his ſeed remaineth in him, and he cannot ſin becauſe he is born of God,</hi> 1 John 3.9. A regenerate perſon may be tempted to ſin as other men; but there is the ſeed of God and of grace in him, that makes head againſt temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>The ſpirit luſteth againſt the fleſh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5.17</note> 
                  <hi>and the fleſh againſt the ſpirit.</hi> Now when men are ſenſible of no ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict as this is, it is a ſign they have not the <hi>ſeed</hi> of God in them, that they want a <hi>principlc</hi> of <hi>grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, There may be a <hi>conflict</hi> between <hi>conſcience</hi> and <hi>ſin</hi> in the heart of a carnal man. I ſpeak this that we may not be miſtaken in our judgement
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64024:23"/>concerning the <hi>ſpiritual conflict.</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>conflict</hi> is not the <hi>conflict</hi> between ſin and grace in a mans heart. There may be a conflict between <hi>Conſcience</hi> and ſin in the heart of a carnal man. A carnal man hath a mind to ſuch a ſin, Conſcience warns him of it, will not ſuffer him to ſin unchecked, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; ſo that here is a conflict about ſin: but all this while there may be no oppoſition in his will againſt ſin. But now in a regenerate perſon there is a <hi>will,</hi> and a <hi>will;</hi> a will inclining to ſin, and a will oppoſing that inclination. But now there is no principle of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition againſt ſin in the will of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate man: the full bent of his will is carried out towards ſin, though there be a fight in his Conſcience againſt it. Therefore when men are ſenſible of no temptations, neither from Satan, nor from their own hearts; it is a ſign there is but <hi>one principle</hi> in them, and that is <hi>fleſh</hi> and corruption only.<note place="margin">Sunt in nobis duo contrarii Duces, caro &amp; ſpiritus. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                  </note> There are ſaith <hi>Luther,</hi> in a Godly man two <hi>contrary Leaders</hi> or Commanders, the fleſh, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Therefore when a man is ſenſible of no temptation, feels no warfare, no conflict with ſin, it is a ſign there is but
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64024:23"/>one principle in him, and that is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of fleſh and corruption. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>carnal men</hi> have no reaſon to pleaſe themſelves that they are not ſo melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and dejected as others are, who are under temptations; certainly it is a ſign that when all things are in peace with them, the <hi>ſtrong man armed</hi> keeps the houſe.</p>
               <p>A third Uſe is an Uſe of Direction to teach us how to carry it when we are under Temptation.</p>
               <p>If it be ſo,<note place="margin">Uſe <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> That it is the lot of the holieſt men, and of the moſt eminent ſervants of God to be exerciſed with grievous and ſore Temptations:</p>
               <p>Then let us labour for the ſpiritual skill how to manage temptations, and to carry it aright under temptation.</p>
               <p>Here I ſhall propound four or five Directions, to ſhew how we ought to carry it under temptations.</p>

                  </note> If we would carry it aright under <hi>temptations;</hi> Let us ſtudy what Gods ends are in permitting ſuch a temptation, eſpecially great and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table temptation to come upon us. <hi>Affliction comes not out of the duſt. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> could not annoy or infeſt us but by Gods permiſſion. Satan is held in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64024:24"/>Gods chain, he can go no further than God permits him. Therefore when we find Satan let looſe upon us, and our peace is diſturbed, let us conſider what Gods ends are in permitting ſuch a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation; why God lets looſe that cruel wolf to worry us.</p>
               <p>Conſider if you have not been too remiſs in prayer, let fall your watch, been too confident of your own ſtrength; wiſely ſearch out the matter why God ſuffers ſuch a temptation to come upon you.</p>

                  </note> 2. <hi>Study</hi> alſo <hi>Satans ends.</hi> As <hi>God</hi> hath his <hi>ends</hi> in permitting us to be tempted; ſo Satan hath his ends in tempting of us. Gods ends in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting us to be tempted are always good, he doth it to humble us, to quicken us to prayer, to keep us in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, to ſearch more into our own hearts, to ſee what is amiſs there. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans end is uſually to diſturb our peace, to weaken our hearts and our hands in the ways of God, or to draw us into ſome plain ſin; now we ought not to be ignorant of <hi>Satans devices.</hi> If Satan Tempt thee to unbelief, to queſtion all, to queſtion whether thou art ſincere, whether thou art in a <hi>ſtate</hi> of grace,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64024:24"/>and have a right to ſalvation, make uſe of the temptation ſo far as to examine thy evidences a freſh. But do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently let go thy hold; <hi>My integrity,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job, will I hold faſt till I die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I ſpeak to ſuch as are <hi>real Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;</hi> few others I conceive are troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with that Temptation, to doubt and queſtion their ſtate, but the <hi>children of God:</hi> Now to ſuch I would ſay, do not preſently let go your integrity, when you are tempted to queſtion your ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and then do not <hi>let go</hi> your <hi>hold</hi> of the <hi>promiſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This a true <hi>propoſition, He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth ſhall be ſaved.</hi> All the Devils in Hell cannot overthrow that truth: Therefore keep thy hold of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſtill, let not Satan be able to beat thee off from the promiſe. Whether thou ſhalt be ſaved yea or no, this is a propoſition of eternal Truth, <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then if it be ſome plain ſin that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan tempts thee to, preſume not on thy own ſtrength, but preſently fly to <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace</hi> to keep thee from that ſin. It is a great part of wiſdom in all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations to conſider Satans ends, which are to draw us off from the word, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64024:25"/>from duty, and to allure us to ſome ſin. Now we ſhould endeavor to fruſtrate Satan in his ends, and beware of his devices.</p>

                  </note> 3. <hi>Reſiſt temptations at the firſt approach of them; Reſiſt the Devil and he will flee from you,</hi> Jam. 4.7. If Satan be reſiſted, he will not ſtand his ground; we have the word of God for it, <hi>Reſiſt the Devil and he will flee,</hi> only let us look to this that we be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory in our <hi>reſiſtance.</hi> Take heed that we do not <hi>dally</hi> with a temptation, but as ſoon as ever a temptation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, preſently to reſiſt it; the leaſt dallying with a temptation brings us under great danger of being overcome by it. If Satan can but get ſo much ground as to draw our thoughts and minds to what he propounds:<note place="margin">Delectatio mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſa.</note> If there be that which <hi>Divines</hi> call a fixing and ſtaying of the <hi>mind</hi> with ſome delight on what is preſented, there is marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous great danger of being overcome. Therefore the beſt way is to keep the enemy at the outworks, and not ſuffer him to come near to our wills and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; when temptations offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to our fancies or underſtandings preſently reſiſt them, not parley with

It is a paſſage I have met with of one that was expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced and acquainted with temptation. The beſt way to deal with ſome tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is to pronounce one ſyllable and ſay, <hi>Fy Satan.</hi> Some poor ſouls when they find ſuch and ſuch <hi>horrid</hi> thoughts caſt into their minds by Satan, are even brought to the brink of deſpair, think it is impoſſible that ſuch thoughts can be forgiven. But let ſuch know if ſuch thoughts be reſiſted and have not the approbation of the will, if the will be carried in defiance to them, they are Satans ſins not thine, they ſhall be laid at Satans door not to thine.</p>

                  </note> 5. In every temptation let us be ſure to keep the word of God nigh unto us, and have a preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to it. The <hi>word of God</hi> is called the <hi>ſword of the ſpirit,</hi> Epheſ. 6.17. No <hi>ſword</hi> ſo fit to kill and ſlay a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation as the <hi>word of God.</hi> If it be ſome ſin in <hi>practice,</hi> that you are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to, take the word, and ſay as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did, It is written, it is written to the contrary. If it be ſome <hi>ſpiritual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> ſin that we are tempted to, as to Pride, Unbelief, or the like, take the word and oppoſe it to theſe ſins. If I am a child of God, and Satan tempt me to doubt whether I am in the favour of God or no, take the word and ſay, <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt?</hi> If Satan ſay thou art a <hi>ſinner</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou ſhalt be <hi>condemned,</hi> oppoſe the word and ſay, <hi>He that believes is not condemned,</hi> John 3.17. If Satan tempt us to doubt of the immortality of the ſoul, to doubt of the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body, to doubt of the future glory of the Saints: If he tempt us to doubt of any <hi>Article</hi> of Faith whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we muſt ſtill have recourſe to ſome word of God that doth clearly and plainly aſſert the things that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64024:26"/>Satan tempts us to doubt of; this is the ready way to ſlay ſuch temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: This is a ſure rule: There is no way to deal with Satan and his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations like to this, As to <hi>oppoſe ſome true propoſition out of the word to what he ſuggeſts.</hi> The Devil tempts me to doubt of many things, I muſt then have recourſe to ſome plain word of God which aſſerts the contrary, and here muſt my faith fix it ſelf.</p>
               <p>If it be ſo,<note place="margin">Uſe <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> That it is the lot of the holieſt men, and of the moſt eminent ſervants of God to be exerciſed with grievous and ſore temptations:</p>
               <p>The laſt Uſe is by way of Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This Doctrine doth naturally ſpeak comfort to tempted ſouls. Art thou tempted? do not deſpond becauſe of thy temptations: do not think ſtrange concerning thy tryals, conflicts and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, as if ſome <hi>trange things</hi> had hapned to thee, 1 Cor. 10. <hi>There hath no temptation taken you but what is common to man.</hi> It is the lot of the holieſt men, of the moſt eminent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God to be tempted; and uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally it is ſo, That the more any perſon is beloved of God, the more dear he is to God, the more God ſuffers him
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64024:27"/>to be tried and tempted. Thy tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are bitter for the preſent, but they ſhall have an end. It is an expreſſion of <hi>Luther,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Diſtinguendum eſt tentationem in initium &amp; ſinem. <hi>Luther.</hi>
                  </note> We muſt <hi>diſtinguiſh a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation into the beginning,</hi> and the end; every temptation hath its end as well as its beginning. Hence is that of the <hi>Apoſtle Peter,</hi>

                  <hi>The Lord knows how to deliver the Godly out of Temptations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true that the ſtrength of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation uſually lies in the length of it. A fierce and ſharp temptation, if but ſhort, is not ſo bitter as a ſmaller tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation if long continued. But yet let us remember, <hi>That God is faithful who will not ſuffer us to be tempted above what we are able, but will make a way for us to eſcape.</hi> Certainly, It is the <hi>greateſt temptation</hi> to be <hi>without tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation;</hi> for when we are without tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, we are apt to be ſecure, and to neglect faith, and prayer, and ſo all of a ſudden are drawn into ſome ſin before we are aware.

                  </note> The Saints are then eſpecially expoſed to the greateſt dangers when they are leaſt ſenſible of temptations. Therefore let us not be diſcouraged by reaſon of our temptations, but arm our ſelves to the

               <p>In the proſecution of this Doctrine, theſe things are to be ſpoken unto.</p>

                  <item>3. We ſhall ſhew you how it comes to paſs, that men of the higheſt grace are in danger of <hi>Spiritual Pride.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. We ſhall ſhew a little what the nature of <hi>Pride</hi> is in general.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pride</hi> may be conſidered either as it is in the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> or as it is in the <hi>will:</hi> for pride is ſeated in both the faculties of the ſoul. Pride it is to be found both in the <hi>underſtanding</hi> and <hi>will;</hi> now we ſhall conſider Pride in <hi>both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. For <hi>Pride</hi> in the <hi>underſtanding;</hi> Pride in the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64024:29"/>thing elſe but a <hi>vehement opinion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vehemens opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio propriae ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellentiae.</note> or <hi>ſtrong conceit</hi> of a mans own <hi>excellency.</hi> And this <hi>pride</hi> in the <hi>underſtanding</hi> hath ſeveral branches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One branch of <hi>Pride</hi> in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is, <hi>when we imagine</hi> or <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a greater excellency to be in our ſelves than indeed there is.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Superbia eſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pergreaiens meatis elatio de to quod non eſt.</note> 
                  <hi>Pride</hi> is a <hi>ſurpaſſing</hi> or <hi>exceſſive</hi> lifting up of the mind concerning ſomething that is not. This is one firſt branch of Pride, when I have an apprehenſion of ſome excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in my ſelf that is not indeed in me. This was in the Church of <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea,</hi> ſhe conceited her ſelf to be <hi>rich,</hi> and <hi>increaſed with goods,</hi> and indeed ſhe was <hi>poor,</hi> and <hi>wretched,</hi> and <hi>miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi> and <hi>blind,</hi> and <hi>naked, Rev.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Pride</hi> ariſeth our of ſome <hi>ſuppoſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in us,</hi> which are not really in us. <hi>Pride</hi> cauſeth a man to think he hath that which indeed he hath not. A <hi>proud</hi> man ſuppoſeth ſome perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be in him which indeed are not in him. He ſuppoſeth there is that <hi>wiſdom,</hi> grace, holineſs in him which indeed is not in him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Pride</hi> in the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> is when <hi>we pore upon ſome excellency that is in us, as if ſo be it were our own
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64024:29"/>and not received. What haſt thou O man that thou haſt not received,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>and if thou haſt received it, why doſt thou boaſt as if thou hadſt not received it?</hi> This is pride when we <hi>glory</hi> in the <hi>gifts</hi> of God, as if ſo be they were <hi>our</hi> own and not <hi>his. Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum ſuperbiae genus — It is the higheſt kind of pride,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin, for a man to lift up himſelf above others, with the gifts which he hath received from God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Pride in the underſtanding is, <hi>when we ſuppoſe there is ſome merit and worth in our ſelves, by which God is obliged to do that for us, and beſtow that upon us which he doth do for us, and beſtow upon us.</hi> Our Saviour tells us, <hi>When we have done all we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſervants.</hi> It is not poſſible that the <hi>creature</hi> ſhould <hi>oblige</hi> God in a way of merit, by any thing he can do; for when the creature hath done its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, it is but <hi>a debt</hi> of <hi>duty</hi> that it owes to God. Therefore when we preſume upon our own worthineſs, to think ſo and ſo, and therefore think God is bound to us, this is <hi>Pride.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:64024:30"/>
               <p n="4">4. The laſt branch of Pride in the underſtanding is, <hi>when we admire and overvalue our ſelves and deſpiſe others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>proud Phariſee, I am not as other men are, I am no Extortioner,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>neither am I as this Publican.</hi> Pride cauſeth a man to <hi>magnifie</hi> himſelf, and think <hi>contemptuouſly</hi> of all others. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be ſome <hi>raal good,</hi> ſome <hi>real excellency,</hi> ſome <hi>real perfection</hi> we are poſſeſſed of, yet it is poſſible we may think too well of our ſelves becauſe of it; the more <hi>good</hi> is in us, the more are we beholding to divine grace, and the better we ſhould think of the grace of God. <hi>By grace I am what I am,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul.</hi> But now this is the nature of pride to cauſe a man to draw down eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing to himſelf; and inſtead of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring the grace of God, which only ought to be admired, pride cauſeth us to admire our ſelves.</p>
               <p>But 2. There is <hi>pride</hi> in the <hi>will.</hi> Now pride in the will is the <hi>overloving</hi> of, or overdeſiring a mans own <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency.</hi> As pride in the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is too great an opinion of a mans own <hi>excellency,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amor ſeu inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatus appeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus propriae ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elentiae.</note> ſo pride in the will is the overloving of a mans own excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or an inordinate deſire of a mans
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64024:30"/>own excellency. Now <hi>pride</hi> in the will, hath ſeveral things by which it is diſcovered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>root</hi> of pride in the <hi>will</hi> is <hi>diſcontent.</hi> It is generally conceived, and not without grounds, that the firſt ſin of the Angels, and occaſion of their fall, it was <hi>Pride.</hi> Now the root of this pride was <hi>diſcontent.</hi> And that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from that expreſſion of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Jude, Jude Ep. verſe</hi> 5. <hi>The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels which kept not their firſt ſtation.</hi> This was the occaſion of the <hi>Angels</hi> fall, they were not contented to be in the <hi>place,</hi> and <hi>ſtation</hi> God had ſet them in, they would be in a higher ſphere than that God had placed them in. A proud perſon is not content with the ſtate God hath placed him in. Some of the ancients make <hi>ingratitude</hi> or <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſs</hi> to be one ſpecies or kind of pride. When a man is not thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the benefits he hath received; but though God hath done much for him, he is ſtill diſcontent, this is one ſign of pride. <hi>Diſcontent</hi> is a certain argument of pride. A diſcontented per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thinks nothing good enough for him, whereas a humble perſon thinks every thing that is leſs than Hell, is a <hi>mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:64024:31"/>
               <p n="2">2. Pride in the will is when there is <hi>affectation of ſome ſuperior excellency, to the place and condition God hath ſet a man in:</hi> This was in the <hi>Angels</hi> that fell, and this was in our <hi>firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</hi> The great temptation to our <hi>firſt Parents,</hi> was this, <hi>You ſhall be as God;</hi> they aſpired after the <hi>Divinity,</hi> there was an affectation of ſome excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency that was above the rank and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of creatures. When a private perſon affects to be in the dignity of a magiſtrate. When <hi>Korah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> affected the Prieſts Office, this was pride. And in general it may be ſaid when perſons aſpire to a <hi>ſuperior excellency</hi> than what is ſuitable to the <hi>condition</hi> and <hi>place</hi> God hath ſet them in, this is pride in the will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Pride in the will is, <hi>when a man refuſeth to ſubmit to the ſupremacy of the Divine will.</hi> When a man would have no <hi>ſuperior</hi> to himſelf. When a man would be his own Lord and make his <hi>own will</hi> a law to himſelf. What greater pride than this, for a man to own no <hi>ſuperior?</hi> For a man to be willing to have none <hi>above</hi> him, that ſhould go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern him? This is the nature of pride. <hi>Wherefore ſay my people we are Lords,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jerem. 2.31.</note> 
                  <hi>we
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64024:31"/>will come nomore unto thee?</hi> A proud perſon is a man that is wholly given to <hi>pleaſe himſelf,</hi> he diſdains to ſubmit to the will of another, he will be wholly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by his own will. This is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of <hi>intolerable</hi> pride, when the <hi>creature</hi> refuſeth to ſubmit it ſelf to the <hi>Divine will.</hi> The perfection of a created will is to ſubmit its ſelf to the Divine and Increated will. Now when the creature caſts off the <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of God, and will not ſubmit to the Divine will, this is an argument of the higheſt pride. This was in them we read of in Jer. 44.16. <hi>As for the word that thou haſt ſpoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken to thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Pride in the will is, when there is a <hi>deſire of ſingularity.</hi> When a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires that the excellency of others may be obſcured, that ſo his excellencies may alone appear. When a man would appropriate ſomething to himſelf; when a man is of this temper, that he deſires ſuch a good ſo as that he would not have others to ſhare in that good with himſelf: this is an argument of pride in the will, when there is an affectation of ſingularity.</p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:64024:32"/>
               <p n="5">5. The laſt diſcovery of pride in the <hi>will</hi> is this, <hi>when a man makes himſelf his laſt end.</hi> When a man refers all things to himſelf; when he deſires the <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>graces</hi> of God and other <hi>good things,</hi> not that God might be <hi>glorified,</hi> but that he only may be ſeen and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired.</p>
               <p>Thus I have ſhewn the nature of <hi>pride</hi> in general.</p>
               <p>We come in the ſecond place to ſhew the nature of <hi>Spiritual Pride,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Text</hi> leads us to the conſideration of that, Leſt I ſhould be <hi>exalted</hi> above meaſure through the <hi>abundance of the revelations.</hi> The pride that <hi>Paul</hi> was tempted to, was not that pride, the generality of people are lifted up with: but his pride was another thing; Leſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure through the abundance <hi>of the revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Spiritual Pride</hi> was his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Therefore I ſhall ſpeak ſomething concerning ſpiritual pride. To open this we muſt know there is that we call <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal pride,</hi> and then there is ſpiritual pride.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is <hi>external pride;</hi> now that which we call <hi>external pride,</hi> is not ſo called, as if it had not an <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64024:32"/>root;</hi> for even in <hi>outward pride,</hi> there is an <hi>inward root</hi> in the heart and mind; but we therefore call it <hi>external pride,</hi> becauſe it is ſuch a pride as ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from <hi>external things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now external pride is diſtinguiſht according to the diverſity of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from whence pride ariſeth. I ſhall only lightly touch ſome parts of <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal pride.</hi> There is <hi>pride</hi> of <hi>birth,</hi> or of <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>parentage,</hi> pride of a mans <hi>family, pride</hi> of <hi>ſtrength, pride</hi> of <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, pride</hi> of <hi>apparel,</hi> there is pride of <hi>riches;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Divitiarum vermis.</note> Pride is the <hi>worm</hi> that doth naturally breed and grow out of <hi>riches,</hi> there is pride of <hi>dignity</hi> and <hi>honor.</hi> Such is the proclivity and propenſion of mans nature to pride, that it is apt to take occaſion of pride from the leaſt things. Such is the <hi>dignity</hi> and <hi>excellency</hi> of the ſoul, that one would think that ſo <hi>noble</hi> and <hi>excellent</hi> a thing as the <hi>ſoul</hi> is, ſhould not take an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of pride from ſuch little things as <hi>paint</hi> and <hi>hair,</hi> and ſome <hi>poor ornaments,</hi> or indeed from any external things that are ſo far beneath the excellency and dignity of the ſoul. But pride is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious ſin, and pride will draw the leaſt thing to it ſelf as an occaſion of pride. It
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64024:33"/>is the property of pride to affect an <hi>oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of excellency,</hi> and when we have no greater thing to make an oſtentation of excellency by, we are apt to catch at every poor thing, every poor ſhadow, to make an oſtentation of excellency by it. One would wonder at what poor things the pride that is in the heart of man catches hold of, to make a ſhew of excellency by. But this is the myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of this evil of pride, to take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion by the leaſt thing to lift the heart up.</p>
               <p>But there is another thing I am to ſpeak of, and that is ſpiritual pride.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>ſpiritual pride</hi> ariſeth from the <hi>undue apprehenſion of ſome ſpiritual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in us.</hi> As <hi>external</hi> pride ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the conſideration of external things: So <hi>ſpiritual</hi> pride ariſeth from the conſideration of ſome <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>internal</hi> excellency.</p>
               <p>Now this I call an <hi>undue apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of ſome ſpiritual excellency that is in us. I call it <hi>undue,</hi> becauſe there may be an <hi>apprehenſion</hi> ſo far of the gifts and graces of God in us as to give to God the glory of his own gifts. But when there is ſuch an apprehenſion of the gifts and graces of God in us, ſo as to think
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64024:33"/>
                  <hi>highly</hi> of our ſelves becauſe of theſe things, when we <hi>pore</hi> upon the <hi>gifts</hi> of God, as if ſo be they were our own; when we forget the <hi>author</hi> of thoſe gifts, when we <hi>admire</hi> our ſelves and <hi>deſpiſe</hi> others, this is <hi>ſpiritual pride.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſpiritual pride, it ariſeth from ſeveral things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is pride of <hi>natural</hi> parts and <hi>indowments</hi> of the <hi>mind,</hi> pride of <hi>wit,</hi> of <hi>memory,</hi> of <hi>judgement,</hi> of the goodneſs of a mans <hi>natural</hi> temper, and <hi>diſpoſition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is pride of <hi>ſpiritual gifts and graces,</hi> pride ariſeth out of our good actions.<note place="margin">Omtia vitia in maletaciis ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>All other vices are to be feared in our evil actions, pride is that vice that is to be feared in our good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. There is pride of <hi>comforts,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual revelations;</hi> this was <hi>Pauls caſe here in the Text, Leſt I ſhould be exalted through the abundance of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations.</hi> If God hath done any thing more for a man either in point of <hi>grace,</hi> or <hi>ſpiritual comfort,</hi> than he hath done for another, no man is in ſuch danger of pride as he is; and he hath moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to watch againſt that ſin.</p>
               <p>Here I ſhall give you ſome brief
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64024:34"/>touches to ſhew you how this ſin doth act it ſelf. The actings of ſpiritual pride diſcover themſelves in ſuch things as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Pride makes a man to forget and overlook all his deformities, and to pore only upon his ſuppoſed perfections. When pride acts a man, it takes off his eye from the <hi>black</hi> ſide that is in him, and his eye gazeth only upon that which he thinks to be fair and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Pride makes a man to forget his own <hi>deformities, infirmities</hi> and <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,</hi> it makes him forget his own emptineſs, <hi>nothingneſs,</hi> and <hi>inſufficiency in himſelf,</hi> and to pore only upon thoſe things which indeed are the <hi>gifts of God,</hi> as if ſo be they were not Gods, but his own.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The acting of ſpiritual pride di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovers its ſelf in <hi>ſwelling apprehenſions</hi> concerning a mans ſelf.<note place="margin">Tamor ſuſcrbiae.</note> I remember it is a frequent expreſſion that <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath concerning pride, he calls it, The <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,</hi> or <hi>ſwelling</hi> of pride; it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of pride to make a man to <hi>ſwell</hi> in great and big thoughts of himſelf. Mark thoſe words in the Text, leſt I ſhould be <hi>exalted</hi> above meaſure:<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> Pride cauſeth a man to be <hi>exalted</hi> in his own
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64024:34"/>thoughts. From hence follows a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring</hi> a mans ſelf before others. Hence is that expreſſion you have in <hi>Deuteronomy, Leſt his heart ſhould be lifted up above his brethren.</hi> When a mans heart is ſwollen with pride, he himſelf ſeems great, and all others ſeem little. <hi>Is not this great Babel that I have built for the houſe of the Kingdom, by the might of my power, and for the honor of my majeſty?</hi> A proud perſon thinks himſelf a <hi>nonſuch</hi> in the world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And then in the third place, That which is the natural conſequence upon this, there is deſpiſing and contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts of others. Pride makes a man undervalue all but himſelf.</p>
               <p>The firſt Uſe ſhall be by way of Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. This ſhould put us upon the ſearch and inquiry into our ſelves, to ſee what ſpiritual pride we can diſcover and find out in our ſelves. Pride is a <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til</hi> ſin, an <hi>inſinuating ſin,</hi> it inſinuates its ſelf into all we do. Pride is like <hi>Ivy</hi> that grows and twiſts about the <hi>tree;</hi> as the <hi>tree</hi> grows, ſo the <hi>Ivy</hi> grows. Pride mingles its ſelf with all we do. And it is one good ſign of ſome <hi>growth</hi> in grace when we can diſcover the <hi>mixtures</hi> of pride in all we do.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64024:35"/>the beſt of Gods children are in danger of this ſin.</p>
               <p>And here I ſhall ſhew, when it is that we are moſt in danger of ſpiritual pride, that ſo we may the more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly obſerve our ſelves, and diſcover this ſin when it doth ariſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then are we in danger of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al pride, when there is any <hi>appearance</hi> of good in us, either as to our ſelves or others. The ground and foundation of pride, is ſome <hi>excellency,</hi> either <hi>real</hi> or <hi>ſuppoſed.</hi> A man is not wont to be proud of ſome thing that is not excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, either <hi>really,</hi> or <hi>ſuppoſedly</hi> ſo; but when there is any thing we ſuppoſe to have ſome <hi>excellency</hi> in it, that appears to our ſelves or others, then we are in danger of Pride. When we apprehend there is an <hi>excellency</hi> of <hi>parts, wiſdom, memory, judgement,</hi> and the like, an excellency of diſpoſition, temper, an excellency of gifts and graces: When we apprehend this to be in us, or others apprehend this to be in us, then have we need to watch, then are we in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſpiritual pride. When a man thinks any thing to be in himſelf, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers think any thing to be in him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he doth excel others, then he is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſpiritual pride.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:64024:35"/>
               <p n="2">2. Then are we in danger of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al pride, when there is an <hi>increaſe</hi> of <hi>knowledge</hi> in us, and there is not an increaſe of other graces <hi>proportionable.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1. That <hi>knowledge puffeth up.</hi> Knowledge where it is not <hi>ſanctified,</hi> it will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puff men up. Knowledge if it be ſanctified is a means to humble men. <hi>Now I have ſeen thee by the ſeeing of the eye,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job, Now I abhor my ſelf,</hi> Job 42.5, 6. The clearer knowledge <hi>Job</hi> had of <hi>God,</hi> the more <hi>vile</hi> was he in his own eyes. Sanctified knowledge humbles. The more we know God, the more we know our diſtance from God; and the more we know the will of God, the more we ſee how ſhort we come of the ſpirituality of the Law, and this is a means to humble us. But now when there is only a growth in <hi>ſpeculative knowledge,</hi> without a growth in other grace, this is apt to lift a man up. When a man thinks he hath more raiſed notions God, and Chriſt, and Spiritual myſteries than other men, this expoſeth him to the temptation of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual pride.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Then are we in danger of ſpiritual pride, when we have had <hi>greateſt aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:64024:36"/>and <hi>inlargements</hi> from the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God. <hi>Aſſiſtances</hi> and <hi>inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> ſhould humble us; for the more we <hi>receive</hi> from God, the more are we <hi>beholding</hi> to God, and the more we ſhould <hi>admire</hi> his grace. But ſuch is the corruption of humane nature, that we are apt to glory in the gifts of God, as if ſo be they were our own. And therefore when we find quickning and inlargement in holy duties, theſe are apt many times to lift us up. But this is juſt as if a private perſon ſhould put on the <hi>Robes</hi> and <hi>Ornaments</hi> of a King, and be proud of them. Theſe <hi>gifts,</hi> theſe inlargements are but the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments God hath put upon us, and yet we are proud of them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Then are we in danger of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al pride, when God hath made ſome <hi>eminent</hi> uſe of us, and imployed us in ſome <hi>eminent</hi> ſervice. There is as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reaſon for pride in this caſe as in the former. For we are more beholding to God for uſing of us, than he is behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us for any ſervice we do for him, for God hath no need of us, and all that we do <hi>for him,</hi> it is <hi>by him,</hi> for no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is any thing, any farther than God takes it up and acts it. The beſt
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64024:36"/>of the creatures are nothing, any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than God takes them up, uſeth them, and acts them: and it is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt honour that God will employ any creature in his ſervice, who could if he pleaſed do all by himſelf without any creature. Yet ſuch is our corruption, that when God hath uſed us, we are apt to have high thoughts of our ſelves, and mean thoughts of others, of whom God hath not made that uſe: whereas this ſhould humble us, that God ſhould uſe us and not others, whereas he might have laid us aſide and have taken up others, and have uſed them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Then are we in danger of <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al pride,</hi> when we are in <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> with others. I remember it is an <hi>ancient proverb,</hi> and it is a true one, <hi>He had need of ſtrong bones that can bear many good days:</hi> truly we may ſay, He had need of ſtrength of grace indeed, that can bear much applauſe and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and not be lifted up. We ſhould glory in the <hi>honour</hi> that <hi>comes from God only</hi> It is true, we ought to bleſs God for any <hi>acceptation</hi> he gives us among his people, that ſo we may be more ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and God have more glory. But <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Eſtimation,</hi> ſo far as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64024:37"/>ours ſelves only, is not a thing ſo much to be rejoyced in; and the reaſon is, becauſe this is the temper we ſhould be of. A Chriſtian ſhould deſire that he might be <hi>unſeen,</hi> and that he and all creatures might be reduced to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that God alone might be ſeen and glorified: but ſuch is the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our nature, that it is marvellous difficult for us to bear eſtimation and honour, and not to feel the riſings of ſpiritual pride.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Then are we in danger of ſpiritual pride, when God himſelf caſts ſome ſpecial honour on us, when God doth not only give us houour and eſtimation among his people, but when God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſets ſome <hi>badge</hi> and <hi>mark</hi> of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon us. When he gives us ſome <hi>eminent deliverance,</hi> ſome eminent <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi> to prayer, ſome <hi>ſignal</hi> mercy or other, we are apt then to be lifted up, becauſe God ſets ſome mark of honour on us, Pſal. 91.15. <hi>I will deliver him and honour him,</hi> we may underſtand it thus, I will honour him in delivering of him. I will deliver him ſo that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance ſhall be honourable and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. Thus God did by his people at the red ſea, he gave them a glorious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance:
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64024:37"/>he did not only deliver them, but honoured them in delivering of them; or elſe I will deliver him and honour him; we may underſtand it ſo, I will firſt <hi>deliver</hi> him, and then I will <hi>honour</hi> him after I have delivered him. Thus God did by <hi>Joſeph,</hi> he firſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him out of priſon and then ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured him, he made him Ruler over <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Now when it is thus with a man that God delivers him and honours him, by ſetting ſome ſpecial badge of favour upon him, ſuch a man is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſpiritual pride. A ſad inſtance we have in <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> God delivered him and honoured him, he gave him a great deliverance, he delivered him from the plague, and gave him riches and honour in abundance; this became a temptation of pride to him; then was <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s heart lifted up, when God had thus delivered him and honoured him.</p>
               <p>Thus I have ſhewn in what caſes we are in danger of <hi>ſpiritual pride:</hi> more poſſibly may be thought of, but I ſhall mention no more. O let us narrowly mark the workings of this corruption in our ſelves, this ſin is exceeding na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and incident to our nature; and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64024:38"/>if we do not ſee pride in our ſelves, it is not becauſe it is not in us, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we want a ſpiritual eye to ſee that in our ſelves that indeed is in us. O let us narrowly look to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this corruption, a little pride doth greatly ſtain and blemiſh our <hi>beſt graces,</hi> our <hi>beſt duties,</hi> our <hi>beſt ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi> a little poyſon, a dram of poyſon, is poyſon; and no fin hath more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom, malignity and poyſon in it than pride hath. I ſhall ſhew hereafter ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the venom and malignity that is in this ſin.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore labour to find out the workings and actings of this ſin in us. He is a rare Chriſtian that carries ſo curious an eye upon himſelf, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to obſerve the firſt buddings and puttings forth of pride in himſelf.</p>
               <p>Labour to be humbled for the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of pride.<note place="margin">Uſe <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> It becomes us to be humbled for every ſin, but above all for the workings of Pride. It is ſaid of <hi>Hezekiah, that he humbled himſelf for the pride of his heart.</hi> No ſin ſo unbecoming a creature, ſo contrary to the nature of a creature, and contrary to the glory of God as pride, as I may ſhew more at large hereafter. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64024:38"/>we ſhould humble our ſelves great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for this ſin, and the more we are tempted to this ſin, the more we ſhould pray that we might abound in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Such is the power of Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent grace, that it can turn our diſeaſes into a remedy and a medicine to heal us. God can by the power of Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent grace make pride a means to heal pride in us. Now we ſhould pray to find the power of <hi>Omnipotent grace</hi> put forth in our hearts, ſo as to make our pride a means to humble us. Divine grace can ſhew us the uglineſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity that is in our hearts by the pride that is in them; and we ſhould pray that this may be a great means to humble us, that we have ſuch a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous ſin as pride within us; for if ever God open our eyes, we ſhall ſee that pride is the greateſt monſter in all the world.</p>

               <p>I Come now to give the grounds and reaſons of the Doctrine, to ſhew how it comes to paſs that men of the <hi>higheſt</hi> grace, are yet in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of <hi>ſpiritual pride.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt Reaſon of it is,<note place="margin">Reaſon <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> Becauſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan <hi>aſſaults</hi> and <hi>tempts</hi> ſuch moſt. None are like to be more fiercely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted than men of the higheſt grace. It is a great Scripture to illuſtrate this,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64024:39"/>Luke 22.31. <hi>Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath deſired to have you, that he may ſift you as wheat. Peter</hi> was one of the moſt eminent of all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Now our Saviours intention was to admoniſh <hi>Peter</hi> of the danger he was in above the reſt. It was not <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> only that was in danger: the reſt of the Apoſtles were in danger of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as well as <hi>Peter;</hi> for our Saviours words are in the <hi>plural</hi> number, <hi>Satan</hi> hath deſired to have <hi>you,</hi> he doth not ſay to have <hi>thee,</hi> but to have <hi>you,</hi> that is, he hath a deſire to aſſault you all and tempt you all; but Chriſt mentions <hi>Peter;</hi> he doth not mention any of the reſt, to ſhew that <hi>Satan</hi> had a peculiar mind to tempt and aſſault him above the reſt; and our Saviour admoniſheth <hi>Peter</hi> of the danger he was in above the reſt, <hi>Simon, Simon;</hi> the repetition our Saviour uſeth, notes the earneſtneſs of the affection with which he ſpeaks. When we admoniſh a friend of a danger, we ſay, Friend, Friend, have a care of ſuch a thing. Our Saviour admoniſheth <hi>Peter</hi> of the danger he was in: though all the reſt of the Apoſtles were in danger, yet Chriſt knew Satan had a particular malice againſt <hi>Peter,</hi> and would aſſault him
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64024:40"/>above the reſt. The more eminent a man is in grace, the greater advantage the Devil thinks to make, in caſe he can foil ſuch a perſon. And although Satan may not think to prevail always againſt a man that hath much grace, yet he knows not but he may prevail. Satan knows that many ſtrong ones have been overcome by his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Our firſt parents in innocency, <hi>Sampſon, David,</hi> and others that were great ſaints, and he knows not but he may prevail upon others. Now if he can prevail over ſome <hi>eminent Saint,</hi> he knows that his conqueſt and triumph will be ſo much the greater. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil knows nothing will be a greater wound and blow to Religion, than if he can make ſome eminent Saint to fall. Now Satan knows that he can undo a man by nothing ſooner, than by the temptation of ſpiritual pride: for, as for groſs ſins in practice, a holy man abhors them, and at the very firſt bluſh of a temptation, when a groſs ſin is preſented to him, he turns away with diſdain. Oh, but ſpiritual pride is a more ſubtil ſin, and the Devil may more eaſily inſinuate the temptation of that ſin, and ſo prevail.</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:64024:40"/>
               <p>The ſecond Reaſon is,<note place="margin">Reaſon <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> Pride is ſuch a ſin as doth <hi>naturally ariſe</hi> and <hi>ſpring</hi> out of our <hi>own hearts.</hi> Pride was the <hi>firſt ſin</hi> that infected the nature of the creature. It was the firſt ſin that did <hi>undo</hi> our firſt Parents: the firſt ſin that infected the <hi>Angels</hi> that fell. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that fell had no tempter, none to tempt them to pride, and yet they fell into pride. This is a clear argument, that there is no ſin we are more inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent unto than pride. Man is indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an <hi>apprehenſive</hi> faculty, and when he apprehends ſome excellency in himſelf that is not in another, then he is in danger of pride in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and when he apprehends ſome ſuperior excellency that is attainable, that he hath not attained unto, then he is in danger of pride in the will, for that is pride in the will, the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of a ſuperior excellency: ſo that there is no ſin we are more naturally ſubject to than pride, it naturally ſprings and grows up out of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>The third Reaſon why men of the higheſt grace are ſubject to pride is,<note place="margin">Reaſon <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe pride takes occaſion from the gifts and graces of God, and cauſeth
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64024:41"/>a mans heart to riſe, ſwell, and be lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up. The more gifts and graces God hath beſtowed upon any perſon, he is in ſo much the more danger of pride. Such is the venom and poyſon of pride, that it turns good into evil; ſucks poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon out of the gifts and graces of God. Pride makes a man to think, doſt thou not ſee how thou excelleſt others? Others have not ſuch gifts and parts as thou haſt; theſe are the workings of pride.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Reaſon <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Where men are indowed with ſome peculiar excellency in any kind, others are apt to have too great eſteem of them.</hi> Now the <hi>eſtimation</hi> of others is a great occaſion and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation to pride; for we are apt to <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue</hi> our ſelves according to the opinion and eſteem others have of us, and this often occaſions in us temptations unto pride.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reaſon <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> Men of the higheſt grace are ſubject to pride, Becauſe <hi>pride is ſuch a ſin as is not ſo ſoon conquered and mortified, as other ſins are.</hi> A man when he is firſt converted, is ſooner mortified as to <hi>ſenſuality</hi> and groſſer ſins; but ſpiritual pride is not ſo ſoon mortified in him. A child of God
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64024:41"/>when he hath gotten the victory and conqueſt over other corruptions, yet he is ſain to conflict with pride all his days. It is the obſervation of <hi>Auſtin,</hi>

                  </note> That God doth not preſently hear a man for the <hi>killing</hi> and <hi>mortifying</hi> of his pride; when yet he deſires to have pride mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with great earneſtneſs, and cry to God with great ſighs and groans that he may be cured of it. And there are ſeveral reaſons why God doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently hear a man as to this thing, for the mortifying of pride, though he cry to him with ſighs and tears that they may be healed of it.</p>
               <p>The firſt Reaſon is, That he may ſhew to us the great <hi>corruption</hi> of our nature, how deeply pride is rooted in us. There is nothing ſhews us the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our nature more than pride doth; for when we have prayed againſt it, and ſtriven againſt it, and fortified our ſelves with all arguments that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly we can againſt it, yet there are conſtant Ebullitions of it; ſo that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhews the corruption of humane nature more than this ſin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God doth leave this ſin in his people, that he may make pride it ſelf a means to <hi>humble</hi> us. For what more
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64024:42"/>humbling conſideration than this, that ſo malignant a root ſhould remain in us, after ſo many means have been to exterminate it?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Laſtly, which I take to be a great conſideration, God leaves pride in his children notwithſtanding all their cries and tears againſt it, Becauſe it makes them feel the <hi>ſmart,</hi> and taſte the <hi>bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs</hi> of the <hi>firſt ſin</hi> as long as they live. The <hi>firſt ſin</hi> of the creature, it was pride; and therefore though God out of the riches of his free grace have pardoned it, yet he leaves the root of it that we may carry our <hi>grave cloaths,</hi> the badge of our ſhame along with us as long as we live. Pride was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the creatures <hi>apoſtaſie</hi> from God, therefore God will have us carry this badge of our ſhame with us to our graves. For theſe reaſons God in his infinite wiſdom permits pride to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue and remain in us; though he have taken away the power and reign of it in his people: yet he leaves the root of it ſtill, ſo as that it is matter of great humiliation to them as long as they live. Thus I have given the grounds and reaſons of the Doctrine. I come now to the Uſe and Application of it.</p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:64024:42"/>
               <p>And the great Uſe I ſhall make of it is this.</p>
               <p>Is it ſo, That men of the higheſt grace are in danger of ſpiritual pride, and to be exalted above meaſure?</p>
               <p>This ſhould teach us to watch and ſtrive moſt againſt this ſin,<note place="margin">Uſe.</note> the ſin of <hi>pride.</hi> I remember it was the ſpeech of an holy man, a wiſe Chriſtian, and of great experience in the ways of God, As he ſaid, <hi>fight not againſt ſmall or great, but againſt the King of Iſrael:</hi> ſo ſay I, of all corruptions fight againſt theſe two, <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>ſelf.</hi> We ſhall have more to do with pride and ſelf-love than with all other ſins; when you have mortified other ſins, yet pride and ſelf-love will be the two laſt ſins you have to conflict withal.</p>
               <p>In the proſecution of this Uſe, I ſhall,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Indeavour to ſhew the <hi>evil</hi> of this ſin, and then 2. Propound ſome <hi>reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> againſt it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſhall begin to diſcourſe a little concerning the evil of pride, that we may be more out of love with it, and have our hearts more ſet againſt it.</p>

                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:64024:43"/>What is a <hi>creature</hi> but ſomething that is from another? A creature hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what it hath received; it is nothing but what it has from another, a creature came out of nothing; it is of it ſelf and by it ſelf nothing, and in it ſelf it tends to nothing. This is the very notion of a creature, if we underſtand what the nature of it is, that it is all that it is from another. Now a creature by pride <hi>magnifies</hi> it ſelf, and makes it ſelf to be ſomething; yea makes it ſelf to be all.

So that take a creature and abſtract it from God, and it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Now a creature that is indeed nothing of it ſelf magnifies it ſelf, and makes it ſelf <hi>all</hi> by pride. The crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by pride lifts up it ſelf, and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates that to it ſelf which is not its own, but hath it all from another. What an abſurd thing is it, that poor duſt ſhould lift up it ſelf, and give out it ſelf, as if it were ſome great excellent thing? That man that is made of the duſt of the earth, ſhould yet lift up

But this we may ſafely ſay, when God permits it to be ſo, that a man is in great danger to be lifted up with ſpiritual pride, and he is overtaken with ſome other ſin; we may then conclude that Gods intention in ſuch a <hi>permiſſion,</hi> it was to cure a greater evil, and ſo in the <hi>event</hi> it turns to good. Let us not miſtake here, that ſin proves medicinal to any, to heal
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64024:46"/>them, this is not from the nature of ſin; the nature of ſin is quite contrary: the nature of ſin is to harden and to damn. Therefore when at any time ſin doth prove <hi>medicinal,</hi> this is from the power of <hi>Divine grace,</hi> that knows how to turn that which is a diſeaſe in it ſelf into a <hi>remedy;</hi> yet this is a <hi>trembling conſideration,</hi> that ſo great is the evil of pride, that God ſuffers his children to fall into other diſeaſes to cure this diſeaſe, which is moſt pernicious of all other.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To ſhew the evil of pride, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that pride is ſuch a ſin that <hi>hinders</hi> and <hi>puts a ſtop</hi> to the communication of Divine grace.<note place="margin">Vas Gratia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> 
                  <hi>God gives grace to the humble,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.

When a man hath a <hi>ſelf-fulneſs,</hi> he is not prepared to take in Divine grace. <hi>God fills the hungry with good things, but the rich he ſends empty away:</hi> we muſt be empty of ſelf, before we can be capable of receiving Divine grace.

When a man ſuppoſeth he hath ſome vertue, or root in himſelf to reſiſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, and carry him forth to any holy action, this is ſuch a thing as is <hi>excluſive</hi> of Divine grace. He that ſuppoſeth that he hath a <hi>ſelf-ſufficiency,</hi> cannot ſee the need he hath of Divine grace. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pride puts a ſtop to the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Divine grace.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Pride is a ſin that is moſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our communion with God, Iſa. 57.15. <hi>Thus ſaith the high and lofty one, whoſe name is holy, who dwells in the high and holy place, with him alſo that is of an humble and contrite ſpirit.</hi> God dwells with humble and contrite ſouls, unto ſuch he delights to manifeſt himſelf. A man muſt be reduced to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in himſelf, before he be fit to receive divine manifeſtations. It is the uſual method of God to bring his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to great abaſement in themſelves, before he manifeſts himſelf to them. It is a great Scripture. Pſal. 138.6. <hi>Though the Lord be high, yet he hath
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64024:47"/>reſpect to the lowly, but he beholds the proud afar off.</hi> God keeps himſelf at a diſtance from proud perſons, but if he obſerve any in the world. it is the <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, lowly</hi> ſoul, that is the ſoul he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in. <hi>Though the Lord be high, yet he hath reſpect to the lowly.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>indangers</hi> a mans ſpiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts more than pride: when a man hath had the comforts of the ſpirit of God, and God hath been affable and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar with him, and he begins to be lifted up in himſelf, this cauſeth God to ſuſpend his comforts. When a man is proud of thoſe things that are <hi>meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> the gift of God; this cauſeth God to take away his gifts from him; and ſo ſhews him what a poor and empty creature he is in himſelf, when the gifts of God are withdrawn.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Conſider, pride makes a man to <hi>forget himſelf,</hi> pride tranſports and carries a man beyond himſelf, pride makes a man forget his own <hi>frailty,</hi> pride makes a man forget that he is a <hi>mutable</hi> creature. <hi>Every man at his beſt ſtate is altogether vanity.</hi> Take a man in his <hi>beſt ſtate,</hi> and he is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to <hi>changes</hi> and <hi>death.</hi> Should a piece of clay be proud? You muſt
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64024:47"/>ſhortly be turned into a clod of earth, and be crumbled into duſt. Pride makes us forget that we are mortal. Whatever external excellencies men are proud of, they are fading and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering, <hi>All fleſh is graſs, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it as the flower of the graſs.</hi> And if a man have ſome ſpiritual excellency, and be proud of ſome gifts and graces of the ſpirit of God; let God but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his ſpirit, and he ſhall ſoon ſee that he is nothing.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Pride cauſeth a man to break off his dependance upon God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſubjection to him. The perfection of the creature lies in <hi>dependance</hi> upon God, and <hi>ſubjection</hi> to him. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of a thing is to remain in the condition, in which it was naturally ſet. Now the creature is placed from the very frame and conſtitution of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in a condition of <hi>dependance</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, and <hi>ſubjection</hi> to him. Now pride cauſeth a man to caſt off his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon God, and ſubjection to him. A proud perſon thinks he hath all of himſelf, and from himſelf, and therefore ſeeth no need of dependance. A proud perſon makes himſelf his laſt
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64024:48"/>end, and ſo refuſeth to be ſubject to another.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Pride maketh a man <hi>to ſtick at no ſin;</hi> pride is the <hi>mother</hi> and <hi>root</hi> of other ſins. A proud perſon that makes himſelf his own end, will ſtick at nothing to ſerve himſelf and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his own ends. Theſe and many more are the evils of pride.</p>
               <p>Now it concerns us greatly to watch againſt this ſin, and that for theſe two Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe pride is apt to ariſe <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly</hi> and <hi>inſenſibly</hi> in us. The <hi>root</hi> of <hi>pride</hi> is ever budding and putting forth it ſelf. There are many riſings and ebullitions of pride that ariſe and ſpring out of our hearts before we are aware. Pride bubbles up in our duties, ſervices and actions before we think, or are aware of it, it is a thing that grows up ſecretly.</p>
               <p>Then 2. If we do not watch againſt it, we may ſoon <hi>grieve the ſpirit of</hi> God, and cauſe it to <hi>retire.</hi> There is no ſin cauſeth the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God to withdraw and retire from a child of God more than ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual pride. Now pride being ſo inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64024:48"/>to our nature, and ſo apt to riſe upon all occaſions; we may too ſoon loſe the preſence and familiarity of the ſpirit of God, unleſs we narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly watch againſt this fin.</p>

               <p>I Come now to propoun ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies againſt this ſin. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe of pride is ſuch a diſeaſe as is hardly cured; nay it is not wholly cured in the beſt of the Saints, while they live in the body, and all the remedies we can think of are little enough to heal this diſeaſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Remedy, Let us ſtudy much our own infirmities and imperfections. It
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64024:49"/>is a ſure rule, <hi>The foundation of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">F adamentum humilitatis cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni io proprii de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f ctus.</note> 
                  <hi>is the knowledge of our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</hi> Nothing laies ſo great a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of humility in us, as the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our own defects. We keep our eyes and pore upon our own ſuppoſed perfections, but we ſorget our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and imperfections. The true ſenſe of our infirmities would ſtrike a holy ſhame into us. As the apprehenſion of what is good and excellent in us, is apt to lift us up in pride: So in order to the ſuppreſſing and keeping down our pride, it is good to conſider our <hi>natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,</hi> and our <hi>ſinful infirmities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us conſider our natural infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, we are but mutable dying crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures at beſt, we are but poor pieces of clay. What little reaſon hath he to be proud, that remembers he is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and muſt ſhortly be turned into rottenneſs and duſt? We may ſay to every one that finds his heart lifted up in pride, as one did that was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to come to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and uſe theſe words, <hi>Remember that thou art a man;</hi> ſo may we ſay, Remember that thou art a mortal creature. As high as thou art, and as much lifted up as thou art in thy own apprehenſion, thou muſt
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64024:50"/>ſhortly be turned into rottenneſs, worms muſt feed upon thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us conſider our ſinful infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider our great defects in grace, conſider our great defects in knowledge, 1 Cor. 8.2. <hi>If any man think he knows any thing, he knows nothing as he ought to know.</hi> How little is it that the beſt of us do know concerning the nature of God? Concerning the Divine nature and attributes? How little do we know concerning the Myſterie of the <hi>Trinity?</hi> How little do we know concerning the union of the <hi>two natures</hi> in Chriſt, <hi>the Hypoſtatical union</hi> as it is commonly called? How little do we know of the <hi>myſtical union,</hi> the union of believers with Chriſt? how little are we acquainted with any of theſe Articles of Faith? In all theſe reſpects we may ſay with him, <hi>I am more brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh than any man, I have not the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of a man,</hi> Prov. 30.2. And as we are deſective in knowledge, ſo we are defective in <hi>faith,</hi> in <hi>love,</hi> in <hi>ſelf-denial,</hi> in <hi>heavenly mindedneſs,</hi> and many other graces. If <hi>ſome</hi> graces may ſeem to flouriſh in us, yet are we not greatly defective in other graces?
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64024:50"/>And if there be ſome good in us, is there not a great deal of evil mixed with that little good? Are there not many ſinful circumſtances that do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the beſt of our actions? It was the ſpeech of an eminently holy man. <hi>There was not the beſt action that ever I did in my life, but God ſhewed me ſome ſinful circumſtance attending it.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what the wiſe man ſaith, Eccleſ. 10.1. <hi>Dead Flies cauſe the ointment of the Apothecary to ſend forth a ſtinking ſavour.</hi> A little ſin is like a little poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon mixed with the greateſt delicacies, it mars and ſpoils all.

               <p n="2">2. Conſider as there are great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of grace in us, ſo we all carry about with us the <hi>body</hi> of ſin and <hi>death, O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>In me, that is in my fleſh there dwelleth no good thing,</hi> Rom. 7.18. There is nothing that is <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>ſpiritually</hi> good, that proceeds from our nature. Whatſoever is good proceeds from the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64024:51"/>ſpirit of God, and the grace of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in us. Corrupt nature that is in us is prone to evil, and nothing elſe but evil; and if we do not always perceive the buddings and puttings forth of this root, yet it is in us: that evil root ſticks in us when it doth not always act in that ſenſible manner. Now what a humbling conſideration is this, that we ſhould carry ſuch a root of evil in us, that bears ſuch a contrariety in it to the holineſs of God? The <hi>holy Angels</hi> never had ſuch a root in them, they never had their natures <hi>vitiated</hi> and <hi>tainted</hi> as we have: and the glorified Saints, though ſometimes they had the root of original ſin in them as we have, yet now they have no ſuch root remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them. What matter of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is this to us, that we have that root remaining in us that is ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the holineſs of God? The holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels have it not in them, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saints are delivered from it. There is little cauſe for any creature, the moſt <hi>perfect, and innocent</hi> creature to be proud; becauſe he is but a creature, and a dependant thing. But how much leſs cauſe is there of pride in a <hi>ſinful creature,</hi> that carries the marks of his
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64024:51"/>ſhame about him, and hath loſt that purity that was ſtampt upon him in his firſt creation? When we have attained the higheſt meaſure of holineſs upon earth, yet remember it is not with us as in innocency, we have the root of original ſin ſtill remaining in us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider what great <hi>eruptions of ſin and corruption there have been in us.</hi> Whatever we are at preſent, we are by the grace of God.

               <p>This is the firſt Remedy againſt pride, to ſtudy our own defects and imperfections.</p>
               <p>The 2. great Remedy againſt pride, and that which I take to be the main of all, is this, Let us ſtudy the <hi>humility of God-incarnate.</hi> This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, no ſuch remedy againſt pride as the ſtudy of the humility of God incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, <hi>Learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart,</hi> Matth. 11.29. <hi>Let the ſame mind be in you that was in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Phil. 2.5, 6. What was the mind that was in Chriſt Jeſus? <hi>He was in the form of God, and yet took on him the form of a ſervant, and humbled himſelf to the death, even the death of the Croſs.</hi> It is <hi>Auſtins</hi> obſervation, That humility whereby God was born of a woman, and by ſuch great indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and contumelies was brought by men unto death, is the higheſt medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine by which the tumor of pride is ſubdued and killed in us. O conſider it, The <hi>moſt Glorious God,</hi> the <hi>moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man.</hi> God is humble, and ſhall a worm be proud? Now Chriſt was <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man</hi> in <hi>one perſon,</hi> and Chriſts condeſcenſion and humility was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great, if we conſider him in

               <p n="1">1. What condeſcenſion was it in God to come into the nature of man, to come into the nature of his own creature, a nature ſo inferiour to his own?

               <p n="2">2.

                  <hi>taking upon him the form

Not by diveſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of his Divinity; that was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; he remained to be God ſtill; It was not poſſible for him to ceaſe to be God. But the meaning is, He laid aſide the manifeſtation of his glory; He did not diveſt himſelf of his <hi>eſſential</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that was impoſſible; But he laid aſide his <hi>manifeſtative</hi> glory for a time. He was content to have his glory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen for a time. Sometimes indeed he did <hi>emit</hi> and ſend forth the raies of his glory in his <hi>miracles.</hi> But otherwiſe, he did for the moſt part keep in the raies of his glory, during the time of his <hi>humiliation.</hi> He was lookt upon as the <hi>Carpenters</hi> ſon. He was <hi>hungry, weary,</hi> expoſed to the ſame <hi>infirmities</hi> as we are, only <hi>without ſin.</hi> All this was his <hi>voluntary condeſcenſion.</hi> The Son of God when he was in our nature, might always have let forth the bright beams of his <hi>Divinity,</hi> ſuch as ſhould have dazelled the eyes of the beholders. But he was content to have his glory unſeen. Now conſider it, If he who was the Son of God, and God, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have his glory vailed and unſeen, dot it become us to deſire to be ſeen and admired?</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:64024:53"/>
               <p n="3">3. But then the depth of his <hi>humility</hi> lay in this, That he humbled himſelf, <hi>even to the death of the croſs;</hi> ſo the Apoſtle expreſſeth it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, The perſon who gave himſelf to ſuffer <hi>was God</hi> though <hi>in</hi> the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>man, For their ſakes I ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my ſelf,</hi> John 17.19. The perſon that ſanctifies himſelf is <hi>God.</hi> So again, <hi>I lay down my life for the ſheep,</hi> John. 10.18. <hi>No man taketh it from me, I lay it down of my ſelf, I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it up again.</hi> Certainly he that hath power to <hi>lay down</hi> his life, and take it up again, was <hi>more</hi> than <hi>man.</hi> No man that is a meer man can ſay thus, I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it up again; therefore he that ſpake theſe words was more than man. Now what condeſcenſion was it for that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who was God as well as man, to lay down his life for man, 1 John 3.16. <hi>Hereby perceive we the love of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he laid down his life for us.</hi> And we may ſay, hereby do we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the great humility and condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God, that he laid down his life for us. O what a ſpectacle of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:64024:54"/>was it to the <hi>holy Angels,</hi> (think you) to ſee him hanging on the Croſs, whom they knew to be the Son of God, and God, although cloathed with our nature, and whom in his Divine nature they had been inured for ſo long a time to worſhip in Heaven?

                  <hi>The beſt remedy againſt pride is the beholding the Lords Croſs.</hi> Let us every day take a turn at the Croſs of Chriſt, and let us by the eye of faith behold the Son of God, and God in our nature ſuffering the greateſt torments to make expiation for our pride. What ſhould humble us more than this thought, that God muſt become man, ſuffer and die for man, to expiate mans pride? If the death of that perſon who was God, and who died on purpoſe to expiate our pride, will not humble us, I know not what will.

I can of my ſelf do nothing, as I hear I judge, <hi>John</hi> 6.30. Now the greatneſs of Chriſts hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility as he was man, appears from theſe three or four Conſiderations, briefly, I pray you weigh them and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them deeply.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that he knew that he had the fulneſs of all <hi>habitual grace,</hi> that was poſſible for a created nature to be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with. <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord did
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:64024:55"/>reſt upon him,</hi> the <hi>ſpirit of wiſdom</hi> and <hi>underſtanding,</hi> the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>counſel</hi> and <hi>of might,</hi> the <hi>ſpirit of knowledge</hi> and of <hi>the fear of the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 11.2. O con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it, Chriſt was humble when he knew he had all that grace that it was poſſible for his humanity to be filled with, and when he knew that he had not the leaſt ſin in him; and ſhall we be proud who have ſo little grace and ſo much ſin? If Chriſt was humble when he had perfection of grace and no ſin, doth it become us to be proud, who have ſo little grace, and ſo much ſin?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt knew that his <hi>humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> was <hi>perſonally</hi> united to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine:</hi> And this he knew was ſuch a dignity, that no creature was or ſhould be admitted to beſides his <hi>humanity.</hi> Now when Chriſt knew that he had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that honour, the grace of <hi>union</hi> which no creature was ever honoured with, or ever ſhall be, but his humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yet he was moſt humble under this <hi>dignity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt knew that his <hi>humanity</hi> was to be uſed as a <hi>conjunct</hi> organ of the Divinity in the work of <hi>mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi> It was by him <hi>as man</hi> that the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64024:55"/>Law was perfectly to be obeyed and fulfilled. It was by him that the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the Law was to be undergon, he alſo <hi>as man</hi> was to make <hi>interceſſion</hi> for us. This alſo was ſuch an honour that no <hi>creature</hi> was admitted unto. No creature was ever intereſted in the work of mediation with God, but <hi>that humanity</hi> of his, <hi>There is one mediator between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5. He knew no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould ever be intereſted in the work of mediatorſhip with God, as his humane nature was, and yet he was humble under this honour.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He knew that after his humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after the work he had to do for the Father, was finiſhed, he ſhould be in the ſtate of his exaltation, be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced above all creatures, Epheſ. 1.20. <hi>He ſet him at his own right hand, in the Heavenly places, far above all prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, not only in this world, but in that which is to come.</hi> It was <hi>Chriſt-man</hi> that was thus to be exalted. As he was the <hi>eternal Son</hi> of God, ſo he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no exaltation. For being in the <hi>form</hi> of God, he was <hi>equal with God.</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:64024:56"/>But he that was thus to be exalted was <hi>he</hi> that <hi>was raiſed from the dead;</hi> ſo we have it at verſ. 20. <hi>Which he wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed him from the dead, and ſet him at his own right hand,</hi> &amp;c. Now according to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity was he raiſed, and therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his humanity was he exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

In Heaven <hi>God</hi> ſhall be <hi>all in all;</hi> this is the perfection of the next world, that the glory of God ſhall ſhine forth through all creatures, and by all creatures; and we ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it our greateſt perfection here on earth to be ſubordinate to God, and to be uſed by him for his glory. Now pride makes us diſtinct and ſeparate from God, who ſhould be referred to the glory of God; ſo that pride is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the end of our being.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Let us mourn over the ebullitions and actings of pride,<note place="margin">

               <p n="1">1. We ſhould mourn over the ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litions and actings of pride in us. It is ſaid of <hi>Hezekiah, That he humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the pride of his heart.</hi> When
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64024:58"/>that good man ſhewed his riches and treaſures to the Embaſſadors of the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> there was pride in it, and God made him ſenſible of it; and he humbled himſelf for the actings of pride. We ought to be ſenſible of all the buddings and puttings forth of pride, and to be humbled for it; And as we ſhould be ſenſible of the bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and puttings forth of pride, ſo 2. We ſhould be humbled <hi>over the root it ſelf. O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death!</hi> When we do not find theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible actings and ſtirrings of pride in us, yet the <hi>root</hi> of it is there. Now we ſhould be humbled that there is ſuch <hi>a root</hi> in us. Pride was the firſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom or poyſon that was breathed by the old ſerpent into our nature. Pride is moſt <hi>contrary</hi> to the <hi>glory</hi> of God, and it is the <hi>core</hi> and <hi>heart</hi> of <hi>all ſin.</hi> As the Naturaliſts ſay of the heart, It is the firſt thing that lives, and the laſt thing that dies; ſo we may ſay of Pride, It is the firſt ſin that lives, and the laſt ſin that dies. This ſhould be matter of humiliation to us, that we have ſuch a bitter root as pride in us.</p>

The way to keep down corruption is to live in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of grace.

                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 3.</note> THE Obſervation that next comes in order to be handled is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the principal end why God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits and orders it to be ſo, that his people ſhould be tempted and undergo ſore conflicts, it is to keep them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lifted up. Leſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure, there was given to me
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64024:60"/>a thorn in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Satan to buffet me.</hi> It is very obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the <hi>end</hi> of this <hi>exerciſe</hi> and <hi>conflict</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi> is <hi>twice</hi> repeated in the text, in the beginning, and end of the verſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is mentioned in the beginning of the verſe, <hi>Leſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then it is repeated again in the cloſe of the verſe, <hi>Leſt I ſhould be exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above meaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that clear it is, that the main and principal end of God in bringing his ſervant under this exerciſe, it was to <hi>ſuppreſs ſpiritual</hi> pride in him, to keep his ſpirit low and humble.</p>
               <p>This therefore is the point that now I ſhall ſpeak ſomething to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> That the <hi>principal</hi> end <hi>why God permits and orders it to be ſo, that his people ſhould be tempted and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go ſore conflicts, it is to keep them from being lifted up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here I ſhall firſt lay down ſome propoſitions for the clearing of the point, And then make ſome applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>I ſhall lay down two or three propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64024:60"/>for the clearing of the doctrine.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Pride is ſuch a ſin that God cannot bear with in his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> God indeed can bear with no ſin, for he is of <hi>purer eyes than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the leaſt iniquity,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. <hi>And evil ſhall not dwell with him,</hi> Pſal. 5.4. God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear with any ſin. But of all ſins, God doth in a more peculiar manner ſet himſelf againſt the ſin of Pride. Pride is ſuch a ſin as doth in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtrike at the glory of God, and therefore God in a peculiar manner ſets himſelf againſt that ſin. Hence it is ſaid, That God <hi>reſiſts the proud,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5. God is the <hi>profeſſed enemy</hi> of Pride, and proud perſons. God, ſaith <hi>Luther, Is the God of humble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, he cannot bear with pride;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deus eſt humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium Deus, non poteſt feire ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>God will have his own glory and Majeſty kept ſafe and inviolable.

A proud perſon would ſeem great and excellent himſelf, and he cares not how the glory of God is eclipſed, ſo he may ſeem great and excellent, therefore God
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64024:61"/>ſets himſelf againſt pride above all other ſins.</p>
               <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">Propoſ. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Temptations when they are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, are a proper means to ſuppreſs and take down pride in us.</hi> And the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe temptations are a means to <hi>humble</hi> us, and ſhew us what is in our own hearts. Temptations ſhew us our own <hi>weakneſs</hi> and <hi>infirmity,</hi> yea not only ſo, Temptations do not only ſhew us our weakneſs and infirmity, but they oftentimes ſhew us the <hi>pravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>malignity</hi> of our hearts that was <hi>latent</hi> and undiſcovered before. Now temptations diſcovering to us our <hi>infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities</hi> and <hi>corruptions</hi> are a great means to humble us. For this is a ſure rule. The <hi>foundation</hi> of <hi>humility</hi> is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our own infirmity: Nothing doth ſo naturally beget humility as the ſight and knowledge of our own infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and corruption. Now God by temptation ſhews us our own weakneſs and infirmity, yea the pravity and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of our hearts, and this is a means to humble us. That temptations are a means to diſcover to us our infirmity, may be clear to us by an <hi>induction</hi> of the ſeveral ſorts and <hi>kinds</hi> of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:64024:61"/>
               <p>I have ſhewed in the opening the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of <hi>Temptations,</hi> that there are <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Temptations, Fleſhly,</hi> or <hi>Carnal Temptations, Worldly Temptations</hi> and <hi>Satanical Temptation.</hi> Now it may be clearly evinced that all theſe ſorts and kinds of Temptations, when God exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth us with them, are a means to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcover to us our infirmity and weakneſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Divine Temptations</hi> will do this: By <hi>Divine Temptations</hi> we are not to underſtand temptations to ſin. The Apoſtle is expreſs for this, <hi>Let no man ſay when he is tempted, he is tempted of God, for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man,</hi> Jam. 1.13. But by Divine Temptations we mean ſome <hi>notable tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> which God brings upon his Children. When God brings his children into great <hi>ſtreights, difficulties</hi> and <hi>afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> that they know not which way to turn themſelves, this is properly a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Temptation. Now theſe Divine Temptations are a means to ſhew us our infirmitie; for this is certain, The <hi>leaſt affliction</hi> which God exerciſeth us with, when we are left to our ſelves is enough to ſink and diſcourage us. <hi>If thou faint in the day of adverſity, thy
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:64024:62"/>ſtrength is ſmall.</hi> Now herein have we experience of our own infirmity, that a <hi>little</hi> affliction when we are not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by <hi>Divine Grace,</hi> will make us <hi>faint.</hi> It is true, a <hi>great affliction</hi> when we have ſupportation by Divine grace will not make us ſink; the power of Divine grace is ſuch, that it will bear us up under great afflictions. But on the other hand, the leaſt affliction will <hi>overſet</hi> us, when we are not ſupported by Divine grace; and we ſhall be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to cry out, <hi>no ſorrow like to our ſorrow:</hi> though there be thouſands that have far greatet afflictions than we have. And if God bring us under any great and remarkable trial, then to be ſure we fall and miſcarry without <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace.</hi> Pſal. 30.6, 7. <hi>In my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity I ſaid I ſhall never be moved. Lord, by thy favour thou haſt made my mountain to ſtand ſtrong, thou didſt hide thy face and I was troubled.</hi> When we are in proſperity we think we ſhall never deſpond more, we think we ſhall go on triumphing to the end of our days: but God brings a little affliction upon us, and then we begin to pine and droop, this ſhews us our infirmity. When <hi>Job</hi> was in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64024:62"/>ſperity he ſaid he ſhould <hi>die in his neſt,</hi> Job 29.18. but when God brought that <hi>ſore trial</hi> upon him, <hi>he curſed the day of his birth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There are <hi>Carnal</hi> or <hi>Fleſhly Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations.</hi> By carnal Temptations we underſtand the temptations that ariſe out of our own hearts unto ſin. <hi>In me, that is my fleſh, there dwells no good thing,</hi> Rom. 7.18. <hi>Corrupt nature</hi> that is in us is prone to every ſin; it is a great expreſſion, that of the Apoſtle, James 4.5. <hi>The ſpirit that is in us luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to envy,</hi> that is, corrupt nature luſteth to envy, and not only to envy, but to <hi>revenge, vain glory,</hi> and every <hi>evil thing.</hi> Now theſe <hi>inward incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi> of the heart unto ſin, and the <hi>luſtings</hi> after it, do ſhew us the deep corruption of our nature. We could not imagine that our hearts were ſo vile and ſo bad, as indeed they are did we not find ſuch corrupt inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and luſtings in them. What is thy <hi>ſervant a Dog?</hi> ſaith <hi>Hazael</hi> to the Prophet. We are apt to think with our ſelves, Is it poſſible that ever I ſhould feel ſuch ſinful thoughts and motions as I feel? <hi>No one would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> ſaith <hi>Luther,</hi> how great and deep
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64024:63"/>the corruption of the fleſh is, till he be tempted and tried. Temptation draws forth that corruption, and makes it to appear in our hearts, that we would not think were there. Temptation ſhews the blackneſs and ſoulneſs of our hearts. Now this is a means to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us; God by temptation repreſents to us the true hue and pourtraicture of our hearts, and this makes us aſhamed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There are <hi>Worldly Temptations.</hi> By <hi>Worldly Temptations</hi> we underſtand ſuch temptations as are offered to us by external objects. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.15. All that is in the world is the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life. The world repreſents variety of objects to us, that are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of temptation to us. The world ſets before us the <hi>allurement</hi> of <hi>profit, pleaſure</hi> and <hi>honour:</hi> and when theſe <hi>baits</hi> are ſet before us, then we have too ſad <hi>experience</hi> how little we are able to withſtand them. <hi>Eve</hi> her ſelf, when ſhe was in <hi>innocency,</hi> when ſhe ſaw that the Tree was <hi>pleaſant</hi> to the eye, and <hi>good for food,</hi> ſhe took there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The ſpirit of God takes notice of that as an occaſion of temptation to her, when ſhe ſaw that the Tree <hi>was
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64024:63"/>pleaſant to the eye,</hi> &amp;c. Now if ſhe in innocency was led aſide by a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation from an external object, much more prone are we in our lapſed and fallen ſtate to be carried away by <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal objects.</hi> When <hi>Achan ſaw among the ſpoils a goodly Babyloniſh garment,</hi> and a wedge of gold, then he <hi>coveted them, and took them,</hi> Joſ. 7.21. <hi>Worldly Temptations</hi> are too ſtrong for us to withſtand and overcome, unleſs we have Divine grace to help us.</p>
               <p>Some of the <hi>ſounder Schoolmen</hi> among the <hi>Papiſts</hi> tell us, That man in his lapſed ſtate hath not power to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand any conſiderable temptation when it is offered. Truly our own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may tell us more, that we are not able to withſtand the <hi>leaſt temptation,</hi> without Divine grace help us; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe ſhew us our infirmity.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There are <hi>Satanical Temptations,</hi> and theſe are temptations that <hi>Satan</hi> himſelf ſuggeſts, and do immediately proceed from him. Now when we are under theſe Temptations, we have too ſad experience, how unable we are to deal with ſuch a powerful and ſubtil enemy as Satan is. He hath many <hi>wiles</hi> and <hi>artifices</hi> to deceive us. Hence
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64024:64"/>it is that we read of the Serpents <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiling Eve through his ſubtilty,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.3. Satan through his <hi>ſubtilty</hi> and <hi>wiles</hi> doth circumvent and overreach us before we are aware. When Satan tempted <hi>David to number the people,</hi> how ſoon was <hi>David</hi> overcome with that temptation, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.1, 2. It might ſeem a very plauſible temptation. Perſons would think there was no great evil in it, for <hi>David</hi> to number his people, to know the ſtrength of his Kingdom; but doubtleſs Satan over-reached <hi>David</hi> in that temptation. His end was to lift him up in pride from the ſtrength of his Kingdom. There is ſo much ſubtilty in Satans temptations, that we cannot withſtand them without the power of Divine grace. It is a ſaying of <hi>Auſtins, Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry believing ſoul is bound to confeſs, that as often as we fight againſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations and unlawful luſts, it is not from our own free will, but from the help and aſſiſtance of Divine grace, that our victory doth proceed.</hi> And another of the Ancients hath this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, <hi>No one that is regenerate is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of himſelf to overcome the ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems of the Devil, but it is by the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64024:64"/>daily help and aſſiſtance of God that we overcome theſe ſnares that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil lays for us;</hi> and this is evident from that petition in the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> when we are bid to pray <hi>lead us not into temptation.</hi> The meaning of that Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that we ought to pray that we may not be <hi>foiled</hi> and <hi>overcome</hi> by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation; now if we ought to pray eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, that we may not yield unto temptation, and be overcome by it; it is a certain ſign we ſhould yield and be overcome by temptation, had we not daily aſſiſtance from Divine grace. Thus temptations when they are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, they are a means to ſhew us our own weakneſs and infirmity; and the fight of our own infirmity is a moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per means to humble us.</p>

                  </note> That <hi>God in his infinite wiſdom, directs and orders the temptations of the Saints, for this very end to ſuppreſs and keep down pride in them.</hi> This is evident from the Text it ſelf, <hi>Leſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure, there was given to me a thorn in the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. This thorn in the fleſh, <hi>this meſſenger of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> it was <hi>given</hi> to <hi>Paul.</hi>

It is an expreſſion I have read in <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> That corruption ſometimes <hi>rages</hi> in the Saints: though it doth not <hi>reign</hi> yet it may <hi>rage</hi> in a Saint as to a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent fit.</hi> Now when God ſuffers cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption thus to rage and tumultuate, it is to humble them, and when he lets Satan looſe to buffet them; God in theſe exerciſes, deſigns to humble them. God and Satan have different and contrary ends in the temptations of the Saints. Satan always tempts us to this end, to draw us into ſin; and God permits us to be tempted to keep us from ſin. God knows how to make uſe of the temptations we are exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with, ſo as to turn them to a remedy. There are ſcarce any temptations that do befall us, but there is <hi>ſome evil</hi> or other doth mingle with them. It is truly obſerved by <hi>Auſtin,</hi> When we overcome temptations moſt of all, yet we have ſtill reaſon to pray, <hi>forgve us our treſpaſſes.</hi> We ſeldom overcome any temptations ſo, but there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of guilt or other that cleaves to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:64024:65"/>us in dealing with that temptation. To be ſure, thoſe temptations that ariſe from our own hearts, thoſe that we call <hi>Fleſhly</hi> or <hi>Carnal Temptations,</hi> there is always ſomething of ſin in them. I will not diſpute whether there be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſin in <hi>Satanical</hi> temptations: Some have ſaid, that there are ſome Satanical temptations, which are our afflictions rather than our ſins; true indeed, if there be nothing of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the will, then they are afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons only and not ſin. But we have reaſon to fear whether there be not ſomething of our own hearts that joyns in with ſuch temptations. But as for the temptations that ariſe from our own corrupt hearts there is alwayes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of ſin in them. The Papiſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed tell us, that the firſt <hi>motions of ſenſuality,</hi> thoſe firſt riſings that ſpring out of the heart, where there is not the ſubſequent conſent of the will, are not ſin: but the tenth Commandment tells us quite contrary. The tenth Commandment tells us, <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet;</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Commandment, tells us, that thoſe firſt motions of ſenſuality are ſin, when he tells us, <hi>I had not known ſin
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64024:66"/>but by the Law, for I had not known luſt, unleſs the Law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not covet,</hi> Rom. 7.7. Where he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calls the <hi>firſt luſtings</hi> of the heart ſin. So that thoſe firſt riſings and luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the heart, where there is not a ſubſequent conſent of the will, are ſin. And in thoſe temptations that proceed from Satan and the world, there is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſomething or other in our hearts that are ready to joyn with theſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations. Now herein doth the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign power</hi> of <hi>Divine grace</hi> appear, that it turns that which hath the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a <hi>diſeaſe</hi> in it, into a remedy.</p>
               <p>Our temptations have ſomething of ſin in them, or elſe are uſually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with ſin, and yet by the power of ſoveraign grace God makes them a means to ſuppreſs ſin. God by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us the pravity and corruption of our natures which is uſually diſcovered to us by our temptations, makes this a means to ſubdue and mortifie our pride, and God in his infinite wiſdom orders our temptations for this very end. <hi>Leſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure, there was given unto me a thorn in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Satan to buffet me. Leſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:64024:66"/>
               <p>Thus have I opened and cleared the Doctrine; I come now to make the Uſe and application of it.</p>
               <p>The firſt Uſe ſhall be by way of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi>

                  </note> This may inform us what conſtruction we are to make, and what interpretation we ought to put upon the variety of Trials, Conflicts and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that God is pleaſed to exerciſe us with. Certainly all theſe things are to humble us; and this is the conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction we ought to make of them, that theſe things are ſent to humble us. Such as are exerciſed with <hi>frequent</hi> and long temptations, that have very little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion in their conflicts; no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er are they out of one temptation, but another ſore trial comes upon them. Such as theſe are apt to deſpond and ready to run into deſpair, and to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus with themſelves, If God did love them, and had any care of them, would it be thus with them? What! never to be at reſt? What! thus to be always upon the rack? But little do we know, the benefit and advantage that comes to us by theſe <hi>frequent</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated</hi> exerciſes, by theſe <hi>long</hi> tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It is a good obſervation of a <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>experienced</hi> man, The

This is the good we get by them though we do not think of it; they are a means to mortifie that <hi>deep rooted pride</hi> that is in us, and to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thoſe infirmities in us, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we ſhould not diſcover in our ſelves. So that when we can ſee no other end in any great and unexpected trial that God brings upon us, we may alwayes have recourſe to this, and ſay, This is to humble us. This is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant uſe we may make of our trials, as to ſay, This trial, this temptation, this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, it was to humble us; this is the diſcipline of my Father to humble me. Obſerve what God ſaith of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when the Lord led his people through the <hi>great howling wilderneſs, wherein were fiery ſerpents, and ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, and drought, where there was no water; it was that he might hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:64024:67"/>them, and prove them, and do them good in the latter end,</hi> Deut. 8.15, 16. So that we may ſafely conclude when God doth exerciſe us with more than ordinary trials, it is to <hi>humble</hi> us, and <hi>prove</hi> us, and do us good in the <hi>latter</hi> end. Whatever <hi>variety</hi> of diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we paſs under, though our <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts</hi> be very <hi>ſharp</hi> and bitter, yet we may conclude, all is to humble us, to reduce us to humility, and to retain and keep us in humility. If ſuch a man as <hi>Paul</hi> needed temptations to humble him, much more do we.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This ſhould teach us patiently to ſubmit to this <hi>diſcipline</hi> that God is pleaſed to exerciſe us with.<note place="margin">Uſe <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> If <hi>Divine wiſdom</hi> think it fit to have us tempted to ſuppreſs pride, and keep us humble, it becomes us to ſtoop and ſubmit to it. No man ought to be angry with the <hi>phyſick</hi> that is preſcribed for his good, and neceſſary for his health. We may poſſibly have ſuch reaſonings of heart as theſe: Could not God bring us to his mind and will, without ſuch ſharp and bitter conflicts and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations? Oh but let us remember this is Gods way. It is not for us to think our ſelves <hi>wiſer</hi> than God: but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64024:68"/>us to ſubmit to the Divine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. I remember I once heard a wiſe, holy and experienced Chriſtian, ſpeak to this purpoſe; I thought with my ſelf that God could if he had pleaſed have brought me to his mind, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed his will upon me without the frequent trials and afflictions I met with; O but then I conſidered this was <hi>Gods way,</hi> and that ſilenced me. We ought to conſider this is Gods way and method to train up his children under conflicts, trials and exerciſes, and this ought to quiet us. We would fain go to Heaven a ſmoother way, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch trials and temptations: Oh but God ſees it meet that we ſhould be tried and tempted; this is Gods way, and it becomes us to ſubmit to it. And however we may think God might bring about his end without theſe things, yet Gods way will be found the wiſeſt way in the concluſion. And herein doth Divine wiſdom appear, <hi>that his ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs.</hi> It tends more to the glory of God, that we ſhould <hi>conquer</hi> and <hi>overcome, under</hi> temptations, than that we ſhould be kept wholly <hi>from</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations; and it will tend more to our
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64024:68"/>own <hi>advantage</hi> in the concluſion; for, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that endureth tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, for when he is tried he ſhall receive the Crown of Life which the Lord hath promiſed to them that love him,</hi> Jam. 1.12.</p>

                  </note> Let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to improve our temptations, ſo as that they may be a means to humble us. Let us labour to anſwer Gods end in our temptations; Gods end in permitting us to be tempted, it is to <hi>humble</hi> us, and therefore our indeavour ſhould be, that when we are exerciſed by temptations, we may get <hi>humility</hi> by them.</p>
               <p>Here the Queſtion may be,</p>
               <p>But how may we <hi>improve</hi> our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations and make uſe of them,<note place="margin">Queſtion.</note> ſo as that they may be a <hi>means</hi> to <hi>humble us?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. When ever temptations come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> let us be ſenſible of the great danger we are in. God by temptation ſhews us the danger we are in. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation ſhews us that if God keep us not, we may eaſily fall into ſome great ſnare and intanglement. Temptation ſhews us, that without Divine grace we are at the brink of <hi>ruin.</hi> Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:64024:69"/>ſhews us, that if Divine grace do not keep us, we may ſoon fall into ſome <hi>foul</hi> and <hi>ſcandalous</hi> ſin. It is not by our own ſtrength that we are kept from <hi>ſcandalous</hi> ſins. When temptation comes, we have experience of that corruption of Nature in us, that would betray us to ſome ſcandalous ſin, did not Divine grace keep us. Now ſhould not this be a mighty means to humble us, to conſider that unleſs Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace keep us, there is not the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt ſoul but might be overtaken with a <hi>ſcandalous</hi> ſin? <hi>Let him that ſtands take heed leſt he fall. Watch and pray,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>that ye enter not into temptation.</hi> Every temptation puts us in remembrance, that there is a whole <hi>chaos</hi> of <hi>evil,</hi> as <hi>Luther</hi> expreſſeth it, that lies before us ready to ſwallow us up, if God did not ſet bounds to the Sea. It is an expreſſion of one of the Antients, Diabolical temptations ſhould put us in remembrance what the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarie is that we have to deal with. <hi>We wreſtle not,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>againſt fleſh and blood,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.12.</note> 
                  <hi>but againſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, againſt powers, againſt the rulers of the darkneſs of this world, againſt ſpiritual wickedneſs in high
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:64024:69"/>places.</hi> They are no mean adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but they are ſubtil and powerful enemies that we have to deal with, when we are tempted. Therefore, let us be ſenſible of the danger we are in. This may be one meanes to humble us to be ſenſible into what great ſins we may fall if Divine grace do not keep us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us labour to be ſenſible of our own infirmitie. As when we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Temptation we ought to be ſenſible of the danger we are in, that there is a ſnare laid for us; ſo we ought to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of our own infirmity, that ſuch is our infirmity, that we may eaſily be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled and overcome by temptations that are preſented to us. They ought to be great conſiderations to us. If <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> If the <hi>Angels</hi> in Heaven did not keep themſelves by their own <hi>free-will,</hi> If <hi>David, Sampſon, Peter,</hi> and other of the Saints did not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come temptations by the power of grace received; what reaſon have we to be ſenſible of our own infirmity? Such is our infirmity, that a little temptation will overcome us without the help of <hi>Divine grace. Peter</hi> was overcome by the voice of a poor Maid, when he was
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:64024:70"/>in the <hi>High-Prieſts Hall.</hi> A little tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation will overſet us if Divine grace do not keep us. Let us not preſume of our own ſtrength. He that thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſtrongeſt will fall the next moment, if Divine grace leave him and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from him, therefore let us carry a deep ſenſe of our own infirmity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let us conſider, as a means to humble us, <hi>How far corruption hath been ſtirred up in us by temptation.</hi> When temptation hath been offered to us, have we not oftentimes found cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption riſing in our hearts, and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with temptation? It is ſaid of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> that holy ſervant of God, that <hi>They provoked his ſpirit, ſo that he ſpake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſedly with his lips,</hi> Pſal. 106.33. <hi>Moſes</hi> was one of the <hi>meekeſt</hi> men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, and yet when a temptation came his ſpirit was <hi>provoked,</hi> and his corruption ſtirred, ſo that he ſpake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſedly with his lips. How often do we find our ſelves exaſperated unto paſſion, and ſometimes inticed to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deſires and luſtings by temptation? Jam. 1.14. <hi>Every man is tempted when he is drawn away by his own luſts and inticed,</hi> that <hi>luſt</hi> that is in the heart, that is, corrupt nature, is <hi>enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:64024:70"/>by temptation; when Satan or the world preſents ſuch baits as are ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to corrupt nature, corrupt nature is ready to joyn in, and cloſe with them. Now what matter of humiliation is this, That temptations when they come, have ſuch a <hi>power</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> upon us, thus to <hi>extimulate</hi> and <hi>ſtir up</hi> corruption? It was not ſo with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Prince of this world came and found nothing in him.</hi> He had no <hi>corruption in him,</hi> and therefore none could be <hi>ſtirred</hi> up in him. It is not ſo with us; But when temptation comes, it finds corruption in us, and ſtirs it up.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let us conſider what <hi>foyls,</hi> or <hi>marks of ſhame</hi> at leaſt we have received by temptation. Sometimes temptation prevails ſo far on us, as to <hi>irritate</hi> and <hi>ſtir</hi> up corruption: although grace overcome in the conflict, and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on break not forth into <hi>outward act.</hi> Sometimes the temptation prevails ſo far in <hi>particular acts,</hi> that the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation is ſuperior in the combate, and we are foyled by it. Temptation gets the upper hand and draws us into ſuch and ſuch a ſin; now what matter of humbling is this? So likewiſe we ſhould
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:64024:71"/>conſider what marks of ſhame tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath left upon us. Truly the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of ſome temptations may ſtrike ſhame into us. <hi>Paul</hi> had the meſſenger of Satan to buffet him, the Greek word ſignifies to beat with the fiſt, to beat black and blew. When people are ſo beaten as that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive marks and impreſſions on the face, when their eyes and faces are black with beating, they are aſhamed to come into company, aſhamed to be ſeen. <hi>Pauls</hi> temptations were ſuch, as that the remembrance of them ſtruck ſhame into him. That God ſhould let looſe Satan upon us to buffet us with <hi>horrid temptations,</hi> with <hi>Blaſphemous Impure</hi> thoughts and the like: although they do not gain the conſent of the will, yet theſe are matter of ſhame, that there ſhould be that in us, that the Devil hopes to get ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage againſt us, otherwiſe he would not thus aſſault.</p>
               <p>The Laſt Uſe is by way of Inſtruction.<note place="margin">Uſe <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> This may teach us when God <hi>lets looſe</hi> any Temptation upon us, what is the <hi>proper courſe</hi> for us to take: the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per courſe to be taken in ſuch a caſe, is, <hi>preſently</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi> to ſet our
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:64024:71"/>ſelves againſt pride, to fight againſt the ſin of pride, and to labour and pray that we may be reduced to the depth of humility. O let us carry this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture always in our eye, <hi>Leſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure, there was given to me a thorn in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Satan to buffet me.</hi> God in permitting us to be tempted, levels at our Pride, ſtrikes at that ſin, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould ſtrike at it. The beſt way to have the <hi>rod</hi> removed, it is to anſwer the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>rod.</hi> Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the <hi>rod</hi> of God upon us; and the way to have this rod removed is to anſwer the end of this rod, which is to be humble, <hi>God reſiſts the proud, but giveth grace to the humble. Humble your ſelves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. The beſt advice that can be given, when ever we find our ſelves <hi>greatly tempted</hi> is this, let us pray much againſt pride, that pride may be mortified and ſubdued in us. The ſooner our ſouls are humbled and brought down, the ſooner will God take off the rod and <hi>reſtore comfort</hi> to us: that is the promiſe, Iſa. 57.15. <hi>For thus ſaith the high and lofty one
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64024:72"/>that inhabiteth eternitie, whoſe name is holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him alſo that is of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite and humble ſpirit, to revive the ſpirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.</hi> The ſooner we are humbled and laid low be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, the ſooner will God take off the rod.</p>

                  <hi>That the proper courſe that is to be taken by us, when we are under Temptation, it is to pray much;</hi> For this thing <hi>I beſought the Lord thrice,</hi> that it might depart from me.

               <p>
                  <hi>Prayer,</hi> it is the <hi>expreſſion</hi> of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to God for the <hi>obtaining</hi> of ſome good, or the <hi>removing</hi> ſome <hi>evil.</hi> Others deſcribe it that it is the <hi>ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of our deſires to him, from whom we hope to obtain what we do deſire. But my work is not to treat of prayer at large, and in the general; but my work is to ſhew how we ought to pray when we are <hi>tempted,</hi> and this is that the Text leads us unto. When the Apoſtle was under this ſore conflict, and had the meſſenger of Satan ſent to buffet him, then it is that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himſelf to Prayer, <hi>For this thing I beſought the Lord thrice, that it might

               <p>There are four or five things I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that are the principal things that we ought to pray for when we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der temptation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We ought to pray that we may know the <hi>ends</hi> of God in permitting us to be tempted, and alſo that we may have <hi>grace</hi> to anſwer thoſe ends. This is certain, God hath <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> ends in <hi>permitting</hi> our temptations. <hi>Satan</hi> could not have power to tempt us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>God</hi> gave him power, and that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from that Scripture, Luke 22.31. <hi>And the Lord ſaid,</hi> Simon, Simon, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:64024:74"/>Satan hath deſired to have you, that he may ſift you as wheat.</hi> That which is deſired is not in our own power; therefore ſince Satan deſires to have us to winnow and tempt us, it is a ſign it is not in Satans power to tempt us without Gods permiſſion. Satan muſt have his permiſſion from God to tempt us, before he can tempt us. Now we ought to pray that we might know the wiſe and holy ends of God in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Satan to tempt us, <hi>God doth not afflict willingly, neither grieve the Children of men.</hi> Temptations are <hi>the neceſſary diſcipline</hi> that God exerciſeth his children with. And if the ends of God were anſwered in our temptations, God would ſoon remove the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from us. <hi>Experienced perſons</hi> know this to be true, that God ſoon removes and takes off a temptation when he pleaſeth. When perſons have been greatly <hi>harraſſed</hi> by temptation, God can all of a ſudden huſh the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation and ſilence it. As Chriſt <hi>rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked</hi> the <hi>winds</hi> and the <hi>Seas,</hi> and there was a <hi>great calm:</hi> So God can all of a ſudden take off a temptation that was ſtrong and violent upon us. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced ſouls have found this, that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:64024:74"/>when ſuch a temptation hath been ſo ſtrong upon them, as that they thought they ſhould never be able to get out of it, and diſintangle themſelves from it, yet God of a ſudden hath taken it off from them; therefore it is our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to labour and pray to know the ends of God in our temptation, and to give God thoſe ends that make God let looſe temptation upon us, and then he can ſoon take off thoſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations that are matter of exerciſe to us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We ought to pray for <hi>ſupporting grace</hi> that we may not <hi>faint</hi> under tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, Epheſ. 3.13. <hi>Wherefore I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that ye faint not at my tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for you,</hi> Heb. 12.3. <hi>Leſt you be weary and faint in your mind.</hi> When temptations are great and ſore upon us; when they are of more than an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nature, eſpecially when temptations are of long continuance, we are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apt to faint and deſpond under them. For this is certain, that the ſtrength of a Temptation lies in the length or continuance of it. A perſon may bear a very great and ſharp affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction if it be ſhort, better than a leſſer affliction if it be long and continued:
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:64024:75"/>the length and continuance of an affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is that that makes us weary and faint in our ſpirits. <hi>Job</hi> when he was under great and ſore trials, he bare them very patiently at firſt; he bare the loſs of his Eſtate, Children, and one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction after another; but when the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction was lengthned out, then there was found in him many fits of impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. So the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they were long in the <hi>wilderneſs,</hi> and <hi>tired</hi> in the <hi>length</hi> of the way, then they began to murmur; therefore we ought to pray for <hi>ſupporting</hi> grace, that we may not deſpond under our afflictions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We may, with <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> to the will of God, pray for the removal of the temptation. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> did in the <hi>Text,</hi> for this thing I beſought the Lord thrice <hi>that it might not depart from me,</hi> that is, he prayed that the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might depart from him: but though <hi>Paul</hi> prayed that the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might depart from him; we muſt ſuppoſe that he did this with <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> to the will of God. He did not ſimply and abſolutely pray that he might be free from temptation, but with ſubmiſſion to the will of God,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:64024:75"/>he prayed he might be delivered from the <hi>preſent Temptation.</hi> Some Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations may be <hi>good</hi> for us, and they may tend to the trying and exerciſe of our graces. Jam. 1.12. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he ſhall receive the Crown of life which the Lord hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to them that love him.</hi> Some tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations may tend to the trial and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of our graces, and therefore we are not to pray that we might be freed from temptation altogether, becauſe ſome temptations may be good and profitable for us. But if temptations be very <hi>heavy</hi> and <hi>preſſing</hi> on us, as <hi>Pauls</hi> was, then with ſubmiſſion to the will of God we may pray to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from ſuch temptations.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We ought always to pray that we might be kept from the <hi>taint</hi> and <hi>defilement</hi> of temptation; and that is plainly the meaning of that Petition in the Lords Prayer, <hi>Lead us not into temptation.</hi> When our Saviour directs us to pray, <hi>Lead us not into temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> his meaning is not that we ſhould pray that we may not be tempted at all; but his meaning is, that we ſhould pray that we might not be overcome
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:64024:76"/>by temptation. Our great work when temptation comes upon us, it is to pray that God would not leave us to our ſelves, unto the weakneſs and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our own hearts, nor to the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi> and <hi>ſubtilty</hi> of Satan. Wo to us, when Temptation comes, if we be leſt either to Satans malice and ſubtilty, or in the hands of our own hearts, Satan is <hi>ſubtil</hi> enough to <hi>intice</hi> us, &amp; our hearts weak enough to <hi>betray</hi> us, unleſſe <hi>divine grace</hi> keep us. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when ever we are under Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, our great work is to pray for divine grace to keep us under our Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations. 1 Iohn 5.18. <hi>He that is begotten of God keepeth himſelf</hi> and <hi>the wicked one toucheth him not. The wicked one toucheth him not,</hi> how is that expreſſion to be underſtood? are not the Saints toucht by Temptation? How then doth not the <hi>wicked one</hi> touch the Saints? There is a <hi>touch</hi> of <hi>temptation,</hi> if I may ſo call it, and a <hi>touch</hi> of defilement; the Saints are toucht with the touch of <hi>temptation,</hi> that is, they feel the <hi>motions</hi> of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. O but he that is born of God keeps himſelf, that is, he indeavors to keep himſelf, and he prays for grace
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64024:76"/>that he may be ſo kept, that he may not be toucht with the <hi>touch of defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> He keeps himſelf, that is, the grace of God in him keeps him from giving the conſent of his will to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation. And ſo far as the conſent of the will is withheld, ſo far a man is kept from the <hi>defilement</hi> of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I mean he is kept from the defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe temptations that are <hi>from without</hi> meerly. For that we may not miſtake here, as for thoſe temptations that ariſe <hi>from within,</hi> that is, the <hi>firſt motions</hi> of ſin that ariſe from original concupiſcence in the heart, although there be no ſubſequent conſent of the will, theſe firſt moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſin; although when there is a <hi>ſubſequent conſent</hi> of the will, the ſin is greater than when there is no ſubſequent conſent of the will. But in thoſe temptations that come meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from Satan, or proceed meerly from the world and external objects; in ſuch temptations as theſe are, if there be no conſent of the will there is no defilement. It is true, it is hard for us to imagine any temptation offered to us by Satan or the world, but there is ſome corruption or other ſtirred by
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64024:77"/>it, and ſome degree of conſent, a <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> conſent of the will; but if we could ſuppoſe an external temptation to come, and no corruption ſtirred by it, nor the leaſt conſent of the will, then there were no defilement. A clear <hi>inſtance</hi> of this we have in our <hi>Saviour,</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation could not faſten on him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no taint, no defilement from temptation, <hi>The Prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me,</hi> John 14.30. There was no corruption of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in our Saviour that ſhould incline him in the leaſt, to the leaſt partial yielding to temptation, but it is not ſo with us. It is hard for us to imagine any great temptation that comes upon us without ſome motions of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore there is uſually ſome partial defilement. Yet we ought to pray that we might be kept from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement as much as may be, by not giving the leaſt <hi>conſent</hi> of the will to temptation. So much as the conſent of the will is kept from yielding to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, ſo far we are kept from the defilement of temptation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Becauſe we uſually get ſome <hi>wound</hi> more or leſs in the conflict with temptation, even when we are victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64024:77"/>in the <hi>battail,</hi> we ſhould pray for the pardon of thoſe ſins that attend our temptations. It is obſerved by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin, No one</hi> is ſuch a Conqueror in temptation, but he hath reaſon to pray, <hi>forgive us our treſpaſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The Laſt thing we ſhould pray for, is, the <hi>ſanctification</hi> of our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations. We ought to pray that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace might ſo concur with our temptations, as that they may be a means to humble us; and that our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations may be a means to quicken us to do thoſe things for which God lets temptations come upon us. God, as I ſaid before, permits temptations to come upon us for wiſe and holy ends, and we ſhould pray for Divine grace to quicken us to do thoſe things for which God ſends temptations upon us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How ought we to pray when we are under temptations?</p>
               <p n="1">1. We ought to pray under a deep ſenſe of our own <hi>infirmities;</hi> we ought to have ſuch a ſenſe of our own infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites as to be ſenſible that the leaſt temptation is enough to foil us, unleſs Divine grace help and aſſiſt us. It is proper only to <hi>indigent perſons</hi> to pray. They that are ſenſible of no wants, ſee
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:64024:78"/>no need they have to pray. None can pray aright but thoſe that are ſenſible of their own infirmity. When we come to pray under temptation, we ought to be ſenſible of our own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; how unable we are without Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace to overcome our temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Satan knows by experience what the <hi>ſtrength</hi> or <hi>infirmity</hi> rather of our <hi>free will</hi> is by the <hi>breach</hi> he made on our <hi>firſt parents</hi> in paradiſe. Satan al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo knows what <hi>habitual</hi> grace can do without the <hi>preſent aſſiſtance</hi> of <hi>actual grace,</hi> by the falls of many of the <hi>Saints</hi> that have been overcome by his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations: we ought therefore to pray under a great ſenſe of the need we have of <hi>preſent actual grace</hi> to aſſiſt us. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our wills be never ſo firmly fortified and reſolved as we think againſt ſuch a ſin, yea although we have the habits of grace in us, yet unleſs we have preſent actual grace in the ſame moment that we are tempted, we are like to be foiled, and that ſhamefully; therefore let us pray under a great and deep ſenſe of our infirmities.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We ought to pray <hi>frequently: For this thing,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the Lord thrice. Thrice,</hi> that is
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:64024:78"/>
                  <hi>often;</hi> thrice in a more <hi>ſolemn manner:</hi> ſo ſome learned men underſtand this expreſſion. Beſides <hi>Pauls</hi> ordinary way of prayer, beſides that he was wont to pray in an ordinary manner; he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>thrice</hi> in a <hi>ſolemn</hi> manner, about this temptation, ſo ſome underſtand it, A time of temptation, ought to be a time of much prayer; when we are tempted in a more than ordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, we ought to pray more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. You know what our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Ask and you ſhall receive, ſeek and you ſhall find, knock and it ſhall be opened to you.</hi> We muſt <hi>ask, ſeek, knock.</hi> If we receive not upon asking, we muſt <hi>ſeek,</hi> and if we find not upon ſeeking, we muſt then <hi>knock;</hi> the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, we muſt reinforce and redouble our prayers. Our Saviour when he was in the Garden prayed three times, <hi>Father, if it be poſſible, Father, if it be poſſible, Father, if it be poſſible,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated his prayer thrice. <hi>Eliſha</hi> when he was to raiſe the Widdows child, prayer thrice over it; and when he came to pray for rain, he <hi>prayed ſeven</hi> times. And as a learned man obſerves, he would have prayed ſeven times more if God had not given him an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, he was reſolved to have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64024:79"/>praying ſtill if God had not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him an anſwer. And what do all theſe things teach us, but that we ſhould not be diſcouraged, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in praying, <hi>for this thing I beſought the Lord thrice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. We ought to pray with great <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency.</hi> One end why God ſends tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptaions on us is to <hi>quicken</hi> us to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; therefore when our trials and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations are more than ordinary, our prayers and cries ſhould be more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. It is ſaid of our Saviour when he was in his agony, he prayed <hi>more earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Luke 22.44.<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>More intenſely.</hi> When our Saviours ſufferings and conflicts were higheſt, then he intended the ſtrength of his prayer moſt. When our temptations and conflicts are ſharp, our prayers ſhould then be moſt fervent. Our prayers are oftentimes cold, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs and lukewarm, therefore God ſends temptations to ſet an edge on them, and that we might intend the ſtrength of them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We ought to pray <hi>unweariedly,</hi> if the Lord do not hear us preſently, we ought not to give over praying, but ought to continue inſtant in prayer, Luke 1. <hi>And he ſpake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:64024:79"/>to pray and not to faint.</hi> It is the way of God to defer anſwering the prayers of his people, that ſo he might give them the more abundant anſwer at laſt; therefore we ought to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied in prayer. <hi>Paul</hi> had not ſuch an anſwer to his prayer as to have the temptation removed, yet he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed praying, and ſo ought we to do; though temptations are lengthned out, yet we ought to continue praying: And although the ſenſe of our unworthineſs might ſometimes diſcourage us from praying, yet the ſenſe of our own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs ought not to take us off from prayer. <hi>Luther</hi> confeſſes of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf he was oftentimes diſcouraged from praying with the ſenſe of his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs; but at laſt, ſaith he, the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> overcame in me, by ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting ſuch thoughts as theſe are, <hi>whatſoever an one thou art,</hi> how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ſoever thou art, thou muſt pray, it is thy duty to pray. God will not be ſought unto, neither will he hear for thy worthineſs ſake, but for his own mercy ſake, therefore we ought to continue unwearied in prayer, and nothing ought to take us off from prayer.</p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:64024:80"/>
               <p>The third and laſt thing I am to ſpeak to in the doctrinal part, is this.</p>
               <p>Why ought we to pray much, when we are under temptation?</p>
               <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">Reaſon <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> We ought to pray much, becauſe we have <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>potent enemies</hi> to graple with. <hi>We wreſtle not againſt fleſh and blood, but againſt principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, againſt powers, againſt the rulers of the darkneſs of this world, againſt ſpiritual wickedneſs in high places,</hi> Epheſ. 6.12. We have all the malice and ſubtilty of Hell to conteſt with; and we have the baits and allurements of <hi>profit, pleaſure</hi> and honour, which we ſee the greateſt part of men are overcome by. And over and above all this, we have the treachery of our own deceitful hearts to deal with; the <hi>heart</hi> of man is <hi>deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked;</hi> therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch ſubtil and potent enemies to deal withal; it concerns us to pray much.</p>
               <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">Reaſon <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> We ought to pray much, becauſe our <hi>infirmity</hi> and <hi>weakneſs</hi> is more than we think it is. There is not the <hi>leaſt temptation</hi> but will be too hard for us, if <hi>Divine grace</hi> do not help us. As ſtrong as we think we are, and as
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:64024:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>much grace as we tkink we have, yet when temptation comes we ſhall ſoon be foil'd, if Divine grace doth not help us. What the ſtrength of free-will is, we have an inſtance of in our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in paradiſe (and we can never think enough of it) and we have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtance of it in the <hi>Angels</hi> that fell from Heaven. And how weak we are for all the <hi>principles</hi> of grace we have received, many of the Saints, as <hi>David, Peter,</hi> and others are inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it; therefore what reaſon have we to pray for continual ſupplies of grace? If the Angels did not keep themſelves in Heaven; If <hi>Adam</hi> in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe did not keep himſelf by his own free-will; If the Saints of God have not kept themſelves by the ſtrength of habitual grace, what are we able to do by our free-will or habitual grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? Certainly our infirmity is greater than we are apt think it to be, and therefore we ought to pray from the conſideration of our own infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
               <p n="3">3.<note place="margin">Reaſon <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> It is one end why God permits us to be tempted, to <hi>quicken</hi> us to prayer; you will find it by experience to be true, when God ſees his people
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64024:81"/>cold or remiſs in prayer, he doth ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily let looſe ſome temptation upon them to quicken them to prayer: and though it be not always ſo, yet it is frequently ſo, that ſome coldneſs and remiſneſs in prayer doth uſually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed our greateſt temptations. I do not ſay it is always ſo, for God doth ſometimes bring great trials and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on his children when they are moſt watchful, praying, and in the moſt holy frame. And when trials come upon us when we are in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, in a trembling, watchful, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frame, then theſe trials are the greateſt mercies. And God by putting us into a praying frame before ſuch trials, prepares us for them before ſuch trials, prepares us for them before they come. Happy is that ſoul that is a praying, watchful, cloſe walking ſoul before temptation comes. But ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily we ſhall find that ſome fit of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity hath overtaken us, before ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable trial and temptation comes upon us. We do not ſee the danger we are in of ſuch temptations, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not pray againſt them; and therefore God ſends temptations to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken us from our ſecurity, and to make us ſenſible of the danger we are in.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:64024:81"/>
               <p n="1">1. This is matter of <hi>reproof</hi> to us,<note place="margin">Uſe <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> that we give way to deſpondency, and ſinking of ſpirit, under temptation, and do not take the proper courſe that is to be uſed under temptation. Gods own children are to be reproved in this caſe, they are apt to give way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondencies, and dejection, and ſinking of ſpirit under temptation, and do not take the proper courſe they ought to take when they are under it. The proper courſe we are to take when we are under temptation, is to pray much; the Apoſtle directs us, <hi>If any man be afflicted let him pray.</hi> So it may be ſaid, is any <hi>tempted,</hi> let him <hi>pray.</hi> Temptation is not one of the leaſt <hi>affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> the Saints meet with; the Saints conflicts and temptations are oftentimes far more bitter than their outward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. Now art thou tried, afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, tempted? <hi>pray, pray. Prayer</hi> is thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per work: but inſtead of praying we <hi>droop</hi> and deſpond; or if we pray, we pray but a little, we are ſoon weary and give over, we think God muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer us the very next time we pray, or elſe we think God doth not regard our prayer. It is an infirmity that is incident to many of the children of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:64024:82"/>God to think, If God doth not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them this day, this week, this month, that then God doth not hear their prayers. But it is one thing for God to <hi>hear</hi> our prayers, and another thing for God to give a <hi>preſent</hi> and <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> anſwer to them. God doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways hear the Saints prayers, which are according to his will; but he doth not always preſently give them the thing they pray for; and it is a great miſtake to conclude that therefore God doth not hear our prayers becauſe he doth not preſently give us what we pray for. <hi>Paul</hi> prayed that the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of Satan might depart, but it did not depart; yet <hi>Pauls</hi> prayer was heard for all that. When we pray for <hi>temporal things,</hi> God doth not always give us thoſe things. God gives us <hi>temporal</hi> things, when <hi>temporal</hi> things are good for us, and when they are not good for us, he denies us thoſe things. But we may take this for a certain rule, If we pray as we ought to pray, we ſhall have an anſwer of our prayers one way or other; either we ſhall have what we ask or ſomething better; and this is certain, <hi>ſpiritual grace</hi> is far better than any <hi>temporal thing</hi> that we can ask.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:64024:82"/>And it is a ſign that we have carnal ſouls if we do not think ſo. <hi>Paul</hi> had not his temptation removed, but he had ſpiritual grace given him, and that was far better than if the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been removed.</p>

                  </note> This ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort us whenever we are tempted to <hi>pray,</hi> and the <hi>more</hi> we are tempted the <hi>more</hi> we ſhould pray. Here lies the skill of a Chriſtian, when ever any particular temptation comes upon him, then to deal with God much about that temptation. <hi>What</hi> we ſhould pray for, and <hi>how</hi> we ſhould pray, I have already intimated. We ſhould pray to know the <hi>end</hi> of God in temptation, pray for <hi>ſupporting</hi> grace under tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation; pray to be kept from the <hi>ſin</hi> of the temptation, and pray for the <hi>ſanctification</hi> of temptation: and with <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> pray for <hi>deliverance</hi> from the temptation. And we ought to pray with a <hi>ſenſe</hi> of our own <hi>infirmity,</hi> and we ought to pray <hi>frequently, fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>unweariedly.</hi> This is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per courſe to be taken when we are under temptations. The Devil is afraid of prayer, when Satan ſeeth that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation puts us upon prayer, and makes
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64024:83"/>us more ſervent in prayer, this will cauſe him to deſiſt from tempting, or to change his temptation. As when an enemy makes an attempt at one fort, and finds ſtrong oppoſition and reſiſtance there, he leaves that and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins his aſſault ſome where elſe, where he may be leſs ſuſpected, and thinks to meet with leſs reſiſtance. <hi>If the Devil find himſelf ſtrongly</hi> oppoſed in his temptation, <hi>he will retire, Reſiſt the Devil and he will flee from you.</hi> And if we can pray, we ſhall be ſure al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to have ſome relief, <hi>For thou, Lord, haſt not forſaken them that ſeek thee,</hi> Pſal. 9.10. God never forſakes praying ſouls, Lam. 3.29. <hi>The Lord is good to them that wait for him, to the ſoul that ſeeks him.</hi> It is a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable expreſſion of one of the Antients, <hi>God is ſo good to his people,</hi>

               <p>IT remains now that I ſhould ſpeak to the fourth particular in the Text, and that is the <hi>gracious an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi> or return that was made to <hi>Paul</hi> upon his prayer, and that is in theſe words, <hi>And he ſaid unto me, My grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi>

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:64024:84"/>there are theſe things that do naturally fall under our conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What <hi>grace</hi> is, And <hi>he ſaid my grace,</hi> what we are to underſtand by <hi>grace.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. What grace is, what are we to underſtand by grace, <hi>My grace</hi> ſhall be ſufficient, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Text doth naturally lead me to ſpeak of the Doctrine of <hi>grace,</hi> and truly the Doctrine of grace is one of the moſt weighty and material points in Divinity. <hi>Alvarez</hi> in his Preface to his Book <hi>de Auxiliis,</hi> obſerves that the Doctrine of Grace is one of the chiefeſt points in Divinity, and that which hath an influence upon all the reſt. And as it is a weighty Doctrine, ſo it is the moſt <hi>ſweet</hi> Doctrine, and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:64024:85"/>it is to none ſo <hi>ſweet</hi> as to <hi>holy ſouls,</hi> and to thoſe that have <hi>moſt grace;</hi> they that have moſt grace will <hi>prize</hi> the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> moſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>nature</hi> of grace in <hi>general</hi> is ſomething of an <hi>abſtruſe</hi> conſideration, but I ſhall indeavour to make it as plain as I may; therefore to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the nature of <hi>grace,</hi> we may take it thus. Grace may be conſidered ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the <hi>cauſe,</hi> or in the <hi>effect.</hi> 1. <hi>Grace</hi> in the <hi>cauſe</hi> is nothing elſe but the <hi>love,</hi> the <hi>favour,</hi> the <hi>good will</hi> of God towards man, 2 Tim. 1.1. <hi>Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father,</hi> &amp;c. The general <hi>notion</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> is nothing elſe but the <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> and <hi>benevolence</hi> of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men. This is the general notion of the word <hi>grace,</hi> and indeed the love and favour of God, the <hi>good</hi> will of God is the cauſe of all other grace, that which we call grace in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, in a ſtrict and proper ſenſe: I ſay, the <hi>love</hi> and <hi>good</hi> will of God is the cauſe of all this grace. Jam. 1.18. <hi>Of his own will begat he us.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle there ſpeaks of one <hi>ſpecial effect</hi> of <hi>Divine grace,</hi> he ſpeaks of <hi>regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> Now he ſaith this grace, the grace
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:64024:85"/>of Regeneration is the fruit of Gods <hi>good will,</hi> of his <hi>own will,</hi> that is, of <hi>his good will</hi> begat he us, ſo Phil. 2.13. <hi>It is God that works in us both to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi> The good will of God, the good pleaſure of God is the cauſe of all that grace that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on the creature.</p>
               <p>But then, 2. There is <hi>grace</hi> in the <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> Now grace in the <hi>effect,</hi> is the <hi>exerting</hi> or putting forth of the <hi>Divine power,</hi> for the producing of ſome gracious effect in the creature, 2 Pet. 1.3. <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as his Divine power hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us all things, that appertain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life and godlineſs.</hi> It is the <hi>Divine power</hi> that produceth in the hearts of the <hi>elect,</hi> whatſoever is neceſſary to <hi>life</hi> and <hi>godlineſs.</hi> It is the <hi>Divine power</hi> that produceth all the effects of grace in the creature. Now <hi>grace</hi> as it is in the <hi>effect,</hi> is either <hi>actual</hi> or <hi>habitual.</hi> That which we call <hi>actual grace,</hi> is the <hi>exertion</hi> or putting forth of the Divine power in order to the producing ſomething in us. Actual grace conſiſts in Divine <hi>aid</hi> and <hi>help,</hi> or affiſtance that is given to the ſoul. That which we call <hi>actual grace,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in thoſe Divine influences which
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:64024:86"/>flow into the ſoul.<note place="margin">Auxilium Di movens nos.</note> 
                  <hi>Aquinas</hi> calls it the <hi>help</hi> or <hi>aſſiſtance of God moving of us;</hi> this is actual grace, Pſal. 119.173. <hi>Let thine hand help me: for I have choſen thy precepts.</hi> Others call this the grace of God that <hi>moves</hi> and <hi>acts</hi> us, and they deſcribe it to be a <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient</hi> motion <hi>or act</hi> of God upon the ſoul: this is actual grace.<note place="margin">Motio Dei tranſions.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But then 2. There is <hi>habitual grace,</hi> now that which we call <hi>habitual grace,</hi> it is ſome <hi>effect</hi> of grace which is <hi>leſt upon us,</hi> which is <hi>permanent</hi> and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>in us.</hi> So that if we would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the <hi>nature</hi> of grace, we muſt conſider that <hi>Divine grace</hi> is either the <hi>actual aid</hi> and <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> of God mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and acting of us; or elſe it is ſome <hi>habitual gift</hi> beſtowed upon us, and <hi>inherent in us,</hi> when it is ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed. Now that which Divines call <hi>habitual grace,</hi> is ſet forth in Scripture by ſeveral expreſſions. It is called the <hi>ſeed of God,</hi> 1 John. 3.9. <hi>His ſeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in him.</hi> It is called by the name of grace in that known Text, 2 Pet. 3.18. <hi>But grow in grace.</hi> To grow in grace, it is to endeavour that the <hi>habits</hi> of grace which are inſuſed into the ſoul by the ſpirit of God, do
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:64024:86"/>grow and increaſe. This habitual grace is alſo called by the name of the <hi>new creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. <hi>Therefore if any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place we are to conſider how the <hi>text</hi> is to be underſtood when it is ſaid, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> 1. By grace here in the Text ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>grace</hi> in the cauſe, namely, the <hi>favour and good will of God,</hi> and ſo they make the meaning to be this, My grace ſhall be ſufficient for thee, that is, through my love and favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, thou ſhalt be ſuperior to thy temptations, thou ſhalt be ſet above thy temptations, thou ſhalt be inabled to overcome thy temptations; though thy conflicts be ſore and ſharp, yet ſuch is my love and favour towards thee, that I will take care that thou ſhalt be ſet above all thy tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, thou ſhalt be ſuperior to them, and overcome them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Others by <hi>grace</hi> in the Text un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtand actual help and aſſiſtance, and ſo <hi>Calvin</hi> underſtands it; by grace he underſtands the help and aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt.<note place="margin">Auxilium ſpirit tus Sancti.</note> Now theſe <hi>two</hi> being <hi>ſubordinate,</hi> neither is to be <hi>excluded.</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:64024:87"/>That which ſeems principally to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended is the latter; namely, the <hi>aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> of Divine <hi>grace, My grace ſhall be ſufficient for thee;</hi> the meaning is, thou ſhalt have actual grace, actual help and aſſiſtance given to thee, to aſſiſt and help thee in thy preſent conflicts. Now <hi>actual grace,</hi> being that grace which is here principally intended; we muſt a little more fully conſider the nature of <hi>actual grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that which <hi>Divines</hi> call <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al grace,</hi> it is twofold. It is either actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al grace, <hi>exciting</hi> or <hi>quickning,</hi> or elſe it is actual grace <hi>aſſiſting.</hi> There is <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al exciting</hi> or quickning grace, and <hi>actual aſſiſting</hi> grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is <hi>quickning</hi> or <hi>exciting grace,</hi> 1 Cant. 4. <hi>Draw me, we will run after thee.</hi> The Saints muſt be <hi>drawn</hi> before they can <hi>run.</hi> So again, Pſal. 119.36. <hi>Incline my heart unto thy Teſtimonies.</hi> Divine grace is of that nature, that it puts a new <hi>bent</hi> and <hi>byas</hi> upon the <hi>will.</hi> The will that was aukward and indiſpoſed to the things of God before, when it hath the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Divine grace communicated to it, then it is inclined, then there is a new <hi>bent</hi> and <hi>byas</hi> put upon it, Pſal. 80.18.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:64024:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Quicken us and we will call on thy name.</hi> It is God muſt <hi>excite</hi> and <hi>quicken</hi> us to pray, before we can pray. Not that we ſhould ſtay off from prayer till we find a ſenſible <hi>impulſe</hi> to prayer. That may be a great tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon a perſon to ſay he will not pray, till he find a ſenſible impulſe to prayer. We ought to put our ſelves upon the duty, out of obedience to the command. The commands of God are, <hi>Pray without ceaſing, Pray always, with all prayer and ſuplication in the ſpirit, and watching thereunto with all perſeverance.</hi> Theſe commands are enough to put us upon the duty though we have not an immediate and ſenſible impulſe. But when it is ſaid, <hi>Quicken us and we will call upon thy name;</hi> we ought thus to underſtand it, that when ever we find our hearts ſtirred up and quickned to the duty, this is from Divine grace, this is actual grace exciting and quickening of us.</p>
               <p>But then 2. There is <hi>aſſiſting grace.</hi> Now <hi>aſſiſting grace</hi> is that <hi>help</hi> or <hi>power</hi> which is given us from God, whereby we are inabled actual to the performance of what we were ſtirred up unto by exciting or quickening grace.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:64024:88"/>The Saints of God may ſometimes have a will, but they may want power and ability to do what they have a will to do, Rom. 7.18. <hi>To will is preſent with me, but how to perform that which is good I find not.</hi> So that there may be a will, but want of power and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to do what we would. Now here comes in aſſiſting grace. It is exciting grace that gives us the firſt will. Now when <hi>exciting</hi> grace hath given us the will, then comes in <hi>aſſiſting</hi> grace to give us <hi>abilitie</hi> in ſome meaſure to <hi>do</hi> that which exciting grace hath given us a will to do. It is <hi>God that works in you both to will and to do of his own good pleaſure,</hi> 2 Phil. 13. This <hi>aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace</hi> is that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, 1 Cor. 15.10. <hi>Yet not I, but the grace of God with me.</hi> Here was aſſiſting grace. The grace of God did coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with <hi>Paul,</hi> therefore the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do commonly diſtinguiſh between <hi>operating,</hi> and <hi>cooperating</hi> grace. <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating</hi> grace is the ſame with <hi>exciting grace,</hi> it works the firſt will; and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating grace is the ſame with <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting grace.</hi> Firſt, Divine grace helps us to will, and puts us upon the doing ſuch and ſuch things: and then there is
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:64024:88"/>aſſiſting or cooperating grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are inabled to the actual perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of what we were ſtirred up to do, by exciting or quickning grace.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting grace is ſeen in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In making us to reſiſt or repel evil.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In inabling us to perform that which is good. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of both theſe together, 2 Cor. 13.7. Now, ſaith he, <hi>I pray to God that you do no evil, but that ye ſhould do that which is honeſt. Auſtin</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves from this Text, That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle prayed for theſe Saints,<note place="margin">Inſpirationem bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ae vobmtatis &amp; operis.</note> the <hi>inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of a <hi>good will,</hi> that God would inſpire into them a good will; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that he would give them ability to perform what was good. For what need had the Apoſtle to pray for them, that they might <hi>do no evil, but do that which was honeſt;</hi> if ſo be that the will of it ſelf were ſufficiently fortified againſt evil, and ſufficiently inclined to do that which was good without Divine grace? Prayer ſuppoſeth a need of that we pray for; a man will not pray for that he ſuppoſeth he hath not a need of. Therefore when the Apoſtle prays
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:64024:89"/>for theſe Saints, that they might not do evil, but do that which is good; he ſuppoſed they needed both, otherwiſe his prayer was needleſs. Now Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>aſſiſting grace</hi> helps as to both theſe, as to the repelling of evil, and as to performing that which is good.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By aſſiſting grace it is that we <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel evil;</hi> by the help of aſſiſting grace it is, that we <hi>do repel Satans Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from without.</hi> And that we do <hi>conflict</hi> with the <hi>evil motions</hi> of ſin that ariſe from our own hearts within.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By Divine grace it is that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt Satans Temptations, 1 Pet. 5.9. <hi>Whom reſiſt ſtedfaſt in the faith.</hi> We are not called <hi>here</hi> to reſiſt Satans tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, as if it were ſuppoſed, we could reſiſt temptation by our <hi>own ſtrength.</hi> For, confider what is ſaid, 1 Sam. 2.9. <hi>By ſtrength no man ſhall prevail,</hi> that is, by his <hi>own ſtrength</hi> no man ſhall prevail. Therefore when we are bid to reſiſt Satans temptations, it is ſuppoſed that it is by Divine grace, and Divine aſſiſtance that we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt his temptations. When <hi>Satan de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired</hi> to <hi>have Peter</hi> to <hi>winnow him as wheat,</hi> how was it that <hi>Peter</hi> overcame <hi>Satan?</hi> Truly it was not by his own
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:64024:89"/>ſtrength, but by Chriſts <hi>praying</hi> for him. <hi>I have prayed for thee,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, Luke 22.32. And what was it that Chriſt prayed for <hi>Peter?</hi> Why, he prayed that his <hi>faith might not fail. Auſtin</hi> obſerves that in this prayer is implied thus much. When <hi>Chriſt</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>Peters faith</hi> might not <hi>fail;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ut haberet in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, liberrimam, fortiſſimam, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victiſſimam, perſeverantiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam vol mta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                  </note> he prayed that <hi>Peter</hi> might have a <hi>moſt free, a moſt ſtrong, a moſt invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible,</hi> and <hi>a moſt perſevering will in the faith. Peter</hi> had not this will of his own, <hi>Peter</hi> had not ſo <hi>firm,</hi> ſo <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,</hi> ſo <hi>invincible,</hi> ſo <hi>perſevering</hi> a will of his own. <hi>Peter</hi> did ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſhew his own infirmity, what the impotency of his own free-will was, when left to himſelf; in that he deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Maſter, when the temptation came. Therefore it was Chriſts prayer for <hi>Peter,</hi> that cauſed him that his faith did not fail. Truly, if <hi>Peter</hi> had been left to himſelf, as he failed in <hi>that particular act,</hi> ſo his faith would have failed totally and finally. It was Chriſts prayer, and not the ſtrength of <hi>Peters</hi> will that kept his faith from failing totally.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is by the help of Divine grace that we conflict with the motions of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:64024:90"/>ſin from within our ſelves. It is a known Text, Rom. 6.14. <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over you, becauſe ye are not under the law, but under grace.</hi> That <hi>ſin</hi> hath not <hi>dominion</hi> over us, we may thank <hi>Divine grace</hi> for it. The Law ſhews us indeed what we ought to do, but gives us no <hi>power</hi> to do what it commands us; the Law ſhews us what ſins we ought to refrain from, but gives us no power to abſtain from them; No, it is Divine grace that keeps us from the dominion of ſin. Sin therefore hath not <hi>dominion</hi> over us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are not under the law but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der grace. Were we left without Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace, ſin certainly would have dominion. So likewiſe it is ſaid, <hi>The ſpirit luſteth againſt the fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5.16. By the <hi>ſpirit</hi> there we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the <hi>regenerate</hi> part in a Saint; as by <hi>the fleſh</hi> we are to underſtand the unregenerate part that is in him. This the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in another place calls the <hi>law of ſin. I my ſelf ſerve the law of God: but with the fleſh the law of ſin,</hi> Rom. 7. laſt. There is the law of ſin, and the law of the ſpirit of life in us. Now the <hi>ſpirit luſteth</hi> againſt the fleſh, that is, that <hi>habitual grace</hi> that is in
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:64024:90"/>the heart of a godly man quickned, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited and aſſiſted by actual grace, this wars againſt the fleſh, againſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate part that is in him; and what then? <hi>Theſe two are contrary one to the other.</hi> It is an expreſſion I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, <hi>Luther</hi> hath,<note place="margin">Sant in nobis duo contrarii da es, caro &amp; ſpiritus.</note> There are two <hi>contrary Captains, Leaders,</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders</hi> in us, the <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>the ſpirit.</hi> The <hi>fleſh</hi> and the <hi>ſpirit</hi> oppoſe one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And what is the reſult of this combate and oppoſition? <hi>Ye cannot do the thing that ye would.</hi> The fleſh or the carnal part in a Believer oftentimes hinders the ſpiritual part from doing what it would. And the <hi>ſpiritual part</hi> keeps the fleſh from doing what it hath a <hi>mind</hi> to do. Thus <hi>Divine aſſiſting grace</hi> helps us to <hi>reſiſt</hi> and to <hi>repel</hi> evil.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By the help of <hi>aſſiſting</hi> grace it is that we are carried out to the <hi>perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance</hi> of what is <hi>good</hi> and <hi>acceptable</hi> in the ſight of God. It is a great Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to illuſtrate this, Heb. 13.20. <hi>The God of peace who brought again from the dead, our Lord Jeſus that great ſhepheard of the ſheep, make you perfect in every good work to do his will, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in you, that which is well pleaſing
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:64024:91"/>in his ſight by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> We may obſerve here, 1. It is the <hi>ſame power</hi> that is put forth for the <hi>producing</hi> of grace in us, that was put forth in rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Chriſt from the dead. Why doth the Apoſtle elſe uſher in his prayer with this preface, <hi>The God of peace who brought again from the dead our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. This intimates that there is the ſame power put forth in working grace in the hearts of the Saints, that was put forth in raiſing Chriſt from the dead. And there is another Scripture that ſpeaks fully to this, 1 Eph. 19.20. <hi>And what is the exceeding greatneſs of his power to us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that believe according to the working of his mighty power: which he wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed him from the dead, and ſet him at his own right hand in the heavenly places.</hi> So that there is the ſame power put forth upon Believers, for working faith and grace in their hearts as was put forth in Chriſt, in <hi>raiſing</hi> him from the dead.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle ſhews us, we muſt be <hi>made perfect</hi> in every good work. <hi>make you perfect,</hi> the Greek word is a very <hi>emphatical</hi> and <hi>ſignificant</hi> word,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:64024:91"/>and we may not let it paſs without a particular examination of it,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>make you perfect;</hi> this word as it appears both from the <hi>Criticks</hi> in the Greek tongue, and alſo from the uſe of it in the New-Teſtament hath two principal ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The word ſignifies to repair the defects of a thing that were in it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorious.</note> and thus the <hi>Greek Criticks</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this word by a word that ſignifies to perfect and conſummate, thus it is uſed in the New Teſtament, <hi>Night and day praying that we might ſee your face, and might perfect that which is lacking
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:64024:92"/>in your faith,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.10. There is the ſame word that is in the Text. Now both theſe ſignifications are of great uſe in this place. The God of peace make <hi>you perfect</hi> in every good work.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is Divine grace that muſt <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, adapt,</hi> fit, poliſh us, that we may be ready to do a good work. We are not ſuited to good works, we are not fitted to put forth one act of faith or obedience. It is Divine grace that fits us for the acting of faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is Divine grace that muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the defects of grace that are in us, and fill up what is wanting in us. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace muſt <hi>begin,</hi> and <hi>Divine grace</hi> muſt <hi>conſummate</hi> every good work in us. So that by this <hi>one word,</hi> the God of peace <hi>make you perfect,</hi> there is a double error confuted. The error of the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Semipelagians.</hi> The <hi>Pelagians</hi> held, that the <hi>beginning</hi> of faith and good works was from <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and the <hi>conſummation</hi> and <hi>perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of them was from grace. On the contrary, the <hi>Semipelagians</hi> diſtinguiſh between faith and works, they affirm the <hi>beginning</hi> of faith was from our ſelves, but <hi>the beginning of good works</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:64024:92"/>was from grace; but yet that this grace was obtained by the <hi>merit</hi> of our ſaith, and ſo by conſequence held, the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of faith and good works was from our ſelves, though the conſummation of them was from grace. But now this <hi>one</hi> word in the Text confutes both theſe errors, for the Text ſhews that the <hi>beginning</hi> and <hi>perfection</hi> of good works are all from Divine grace. It is <hi>Divine</hi> grace that muſt <hi>begin</hi> good works, and it is <hi>grace</hi> that muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and finiſh good works in us. It is Divine grace that muſt begin every good work, it is Divine grace that muſt <hi>frame</hi> and compoſe us to good works. <hi>We are his workmanſhip crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Chriſt Jeſus to good works,</hi> 2 Epheſ. 10. So that we are <hi>created</hi> to good works.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is Divine grace that <hi>perfects</hi> good works in us, when they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun. <hi>The God of peace make you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in every good work.</hi> Hence it is that Chriſt is ſaid to be not only the Author, but Finiſher of our faith, Heb. 12.3. <hi>Looking unto Jeſus the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Finiſher of our faith:</hi> what more clear than theſe things?</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Apoſtle is not content to ſay
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:64024:93"/>
                  <hi>make you perfect,</hi> but he amplifieth and expreſſeth himſelf yet <hi>farther, Working in you that which is pleaſing in his ſight by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Here he plainly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms that it is God that works in us what ever is good and pleaſing to him. So that it is clear and evident, that the Apoſtle aſcribes the honour of all to <hi>Divine</hi> grace.

               <p>The<note place="margin">2. Particular.</note> thing to be ſpoken to is this, How grace is ſaid to be <hi>ſufficient</hi> for us, <hi>My grace ſhall be ſufficient for thee.</hi> Grace may be ſaid to be ſufficient for the Saints, upon ſeveral accounts. There are theſe things implied in this Phraſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When God promiſeth that his grace ſhall be <hi>ſufficient</hi> for us, his meaning is, that he will not <hi>leave</hi> his people <hi>to themſelves,</hi> but give them <hi>Divine aid, help, ſuccour</hi> and <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> in their temptations. This the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words make out to be the meaning, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee,</hi> why ſo? <hi>For my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs.</hi> As much as if it had been ſaid, The grace of God ſhall be <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> for his people, ſo as that he will not fail to give Divine ſtrength and aſſiſtance to them according to their neceſſities. Therefore when the Lord
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:64024:94"/>promiſeth a ſufficiency of grace, the meaning is, he will not leave us to our ſelves, but he will give Divine aid, and help, and <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> of grace to us, ſo that we ſhall have <hi>grace</hi> to <hi>help</hi> in time of need, that is the expreſſion, Heb. 4. laſt. <hi>Let us come holdly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need:</hi> then is Divine grace ſaid to be ſufficient when we have Divine help and aſſiſtance given to us in every <hi>time</hi> of <hi>need.</hi> It is a ſweet and precious promiſe, Iſa. 41.17. <hi>When the poor and needy ſeek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirſt, I the Lord will hear them, I the God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael will not forſake them.</hi> Here is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a <hi>promiſe of Divine grace.

                  </gap> this promiſe, He know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not whether there be any promiſe more effectual in the whole Scripture, for the comforting afflicted conſciences than this promiſe. Here is a promiſe of <hi>Divine</hi> grace, and the grace that is here ſpoken of, is either to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> viz. the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>grace.</hi> It ſeems clearly to be a propheſie concerning the <hi>Gontiles,</hi> when
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64024:94"/>they ſhall thirſt after the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and the ſpirit of grace, what then? ſaith the Text, <hi>I the Lord will hear them, I the God of Iſrael will not forſake them.</hi> That they did <hi>deſire</hi> grace, this was ſome beginning of grace, <hi>To deſire the help and aſſiſtance of grace is the beginning of grace.</hi>

                  </note> It was a ſign that the grace of God had been at work in their hearts, that they began to ſeek after grace. When the poor and needy ſeek for water, that is, when they ſeek after grace, well, but what is the iſſue? <hi>I the Lord will hear them, I the God of Iſrael will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them.</hi> God is never wont to leave them <hi>deſtitute</hi> of grace, who are <hi>breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> after grace. The very deſire of grace, is the beginning of grace; and the ſame grace that hath wrought a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in us after grace, will alſo give us the grace that we do deſire, for it is God that works in us, <hi>both to will and to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. When the Lord promiſeth his <hi>grace</hi> ſhall be <hi>ſufficient;</hi> his meaning is, that he will give <hi>ſuitable</hi> and <hi>proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable</hi> grace to our temptations and trials. He doth not only promiſe to give us <hi>ſome</hi> grace, but <hi>ſuitable</hi> grace; grace
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:64024:95"/>
                  <hi>ſuitable</hi> and <hi>proportionable</hi> to our trials and temptations. <hi>My grace ſhall be ſufficient for thee:</hi> the meaning is, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature, quality and greatneſs of our trials and temptation, ſo ſhall our ſtrength be. If our tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be more than ordinary, we ſhall have more than ordinary aſſiſtance, and greater meaſures of grace. A pregnant Scripture we have to confirm this, 1 Cor. 10.13. <hi>There hath no tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion taken you, but ſuch as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo make a way to eſcape, that ye may be able to bear it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two things are here promiſed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A <hi>gracious Iſſue</hi> to the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Strength proportionable</hi> to the temptation whilſt we are under it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One thing here promiſed is a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Iſſue unto the temptation. God will <hi>make way for you to eſcape.</hi> We ought to diſtinguiſh the temptation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the beginning, and the end, every temptation hath <hi>an end</hi> as well as a <hi>beginning.</hi> We ſee the <hi>beginning</hi> and <hi>progreſs</hi> of a temptation, but ſo weak
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:64024:95"/>is our faith, we are not able to ſee to the end of it; but now the word tells us, it ſhall have an end, he will <hi>make way</hi> for us to eſcape. Therefore we ought to labour by the eye of faith to ſee to the end of our temptations. Could we by the eye of faith, ſee to the end of our temptations, it would greatly relieve us under them; Now ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle, God will make way for us to eſcape.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 2. thing promiſed is proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſtrength to the temptation whilſt we are under it. God is faithful who will not ſuffer ye to be tempted, <hi>above what you are able;</hi> we are not able to bear the leaſt temptation. Why then is it ſaid that God will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that you are able? Are we able to ſtand under any temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? No certainly, the leaſt temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is enough to overſet and overbear us, if we be left to our ſelves. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are we taught to pray, <hi>Lead us not into temptation;</hi> certainly, if we were able to overcome temptation by our own ſtrength, our Saviour would never bid us to pray, <hi>Lead us not into tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.</hi> When we are bid to pray, <hi>Lead us not into temptation,</hi> we are in effect
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:64024:96"/>bid to pray for Divine grace to keep us from being overcome by temptation; and if we muſt pray for grace to help us againſt temptation, it is a certain ſign we have not ſtrength of our ſelves to deal with any temptation without Divine grace. How then is it ſaid, that God is faithful, who will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to be tempted above that you are able? The meaning certainly is this, God will not ſuffer you to be tempted above what his grace will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able you to grapple and deal with the temptation. God will ſo moderate, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and qualifie the temptation it ſelf, and he will give ſuch <hi>ſupplies</hi> of <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſtrength</hi> to you, that you ſhall be able to ſtand under it; for ſo it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>That ye may be able to bear it.</hi> Did not Divine grace aſſiſt us, we ſhould not be able to <hi>bear</hi> the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but we ſhould certainly fail un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it; therefore the Lord promiſeth us a <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of grace and ſtrength to <hi>bear us up</hi> under the temptation.</p>
               <p>I ſhall proceed no further in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication at preſent, but come to a little <hi>Uſe</hi> and <hi>Application</hi> of what hath been already opened of the Doctrine of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace.</p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:64024:96"/>

                  </note> that there is little reaſon why men ſhould <hi>magnifie</hi> nature, and cry up the <hi>power</hi> of nature ſo much. Some of the <hi>Antient Philoſophers</hi> cried up the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> and tell us, that men are born with the <hi>ſeeds</hi> of <hi>vertue</hi> in them. The <hi>Pelagians</hi> of old affirmed that <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>free-will</hi> was ſufficient of it ſelf as to the <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>obedience</hi> without <hi>internal grace.</hi> And ſome in our days cry up <hi>moral vertue,</hi> and count it a great crime for any man to make a difference between grace and <hi>moral ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi> But let us conſider this Text. We may find enough in this Text to confute all theſe <hi>notions;</hi> conſider what is ſaid here unto <hi>Paul, My grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> Why is it that God promiſeth his grace to <hi>Paul?</hi> Some magnifie the power of nature, and cry that up: and ſome magnifie <hi>moral ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> and level grace with it, making moral vertue and grace all one. Now let us conſider, had not <hi>Paul</hi> as much of nature, as much of the ſtrength of free-will as other men, had he not as much <hi>good nature</hi> in him as other men? Nay, was not <hi>Paul</hi> brought to as high

                  <hi>Paul,</hi> thou haſt ſtrength enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel thy temptations; thou haſt the power of nature, the ſtrength of thy free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, the habits of grace, and theſe are weapons enough to furniſh thee againſt thy temptations. But on the contrary, Chriſt tells him, <hi>My grace ſhall be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for thee;</hi> and what doth this but plainly intimate, that <hi>Pauls</hi> free-will, the power of nature, nay, the power of habitual <hi>grace</hi> received, had not been ſufficient for him, had not preſent actual grace aſſiſted him? God doth not <hi>promiſe</hi> us that which is in our <hi>own</hi> power. If he promiſe <hi>his grace</hi> ſhall be ſufficient for us, it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſign that without grace we can do nothing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us labour to ſee the <hi>neceſſity</hi> and <hi>excellency</hi> of Divine grace.<note place="margin">Uſe <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> When God would promiſe <hi>the beſt thing</hi> to <hi>Paul</hi> that he could give him, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth <hi>divine</hi> grace to him, <hi>My grace ſhall be ſufficient for thee.</hi> O the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is in Divine grace!

               <p>
                  <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerves that <hi>Divine grace</hi> conſiſts in a certain <hi>ſpiritual ſuavity</hi> that is let in upon the ſoul.</p>

               <p>I may have occaſion hereafter to ſhew the reaſon of that <hi>unutterable ſweetneſs</hi> that is in Divine grace, and there is a great account to be given of it. Certainly if we have indeed <hi>taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Lord is gracious,</hi> as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3. we ſhall find ſuch a ſweetneſs in grace, that we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver found in any thing elſe. And if we do not find unutterable ſweetneſs in Divine grace, above what we find in <hi>external things,</hi> it is a certain ſign we have but a little grace. Carnal men dote upon carnal pleaſures, but the reaſon is, becauſe they think there is no higher ſweetneſs. <hi>Auſtin, that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man</hi> profeſſeth, that God had allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him with the ſweetneſs of his grace, and now it was moſt ſweet to him to want other ſweetneſſes. O let us labour to experiment the ſweetneſs of Divine grace. If once we have experimented the ſweetneſs of Divine grace, we ſhall value that above all other ſweetneſſes whatſoever; but of this more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

               <p>THat which we were laſt treating of in the Doctrinal part, was, how grace is ſaid to be ſufficient for the Saints; and two particulars have been already mentioned.</p>
               <p>The 3. Particular is this,<note place="margin">3. Particular how Grace is ſaid to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.</note> Gods grace is ſaid to be ſufficient, in that Divine grace ſhall not be <hi>wanting</hi> when it is <hi>neceſſary.</hi> As God will give out grace ſuitable to the trials and temptations of his Children; ſo he will give out grace to them in the <hi>fitteſt</hi> and moſt <hi>opportune</hi> time, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. I have heard thee in an <hi>accepted time.</hi> God may, and oftentimes doth permit things to come to <hi>extremity</hi> with his people, but when it is come to <hi>extremity,</hi> then
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:64024:99"/>he is ſure to help them. You know what was ſaid in that caſe, <hi>In the mount will the Lord be ſeen.</hi> When <hi>Iſaac</hi> was juſt ready to be ſacrificed, and the knife put to his throat, then did the Lord ſtep in and help. So likewiſe, Jonah 2.2. <hi>I cried by reaſon of my affliction to the Lord, and he heard me; out of the belly of Hell cried I, and thou heard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt my voice. Jonah</hi> was in the <hi>Whales belly,</hi> which was to him in his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as the <hi>belly</hi> of <hi>hell,</hi> becauſe he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended <hi>Divine diſpleaſure</hi> in it; there he ſaw no hope of deliverance, but then did he cry to the Lord, and the Lord heard and delivered him. It is an obſervation of <hi>Luther,</hi> God doth many times not hear his people till it come to the very laſt ſigh and groan that is in their hearts, and when they can <hi>pray,</hi> and <hi>ſigh,</hi> and <hi>groan</hi> no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, then God hears them. Now then is Divine grace ſaid to be ſufficient, when grace ſteps in and helps us in the moſt <hi>opportune</hi> time, in the very <hi>nick,</hi> and utmoſt time of extremity, Pſal. 116.3. <hi>The ſorrows of death compaſs me, and the pains of Hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and ſorrow.</hi> What then? <hi>I was brought low, and the Lord
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:64024:99"/>helped me.</hi> So in another place, <hi>Who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred us in our low eſtate, for his mercy indureth for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the laſt place,<note place="margin">Partic. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> Grace is ſaid to be ſufficient, when, <hi>as</hi> our temptations and trials are continued and <hi>lengthned</hi> out, <hi>ſo</hi> Divine grace is <hi>continued</hi> and lengthned out. If God ſhould give us Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine help and aſſiſtance at one time, and withdraw it from us at another time, we ſhould certainly fail. But then grace is ſaid to be ſufficient when there is a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation</hi> of <hi>Divine</hi> grace: and as our temptations and trials are lengthned out, ſo divine grace is continued and lengthned out to us, and this ſeems to be the plain caſe in the Text. <hi>Paul</hi> could not obtain fredom from his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, but he obtained this anſwer, that Gods grace ſhould be ſufficient for him; the meaning is, God would not ſo anſwer him, as to remove the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation from him; the temptation ſhould continue ſtill; yet <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould have this anſwer, that he ſhould not be deſerted in point of grace; grace ſhould continue conſtant with him, till the temptation was brought to a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. And thus <hi>grace</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> for us, when though our tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:64024:100"/>are great and of long continuance, yet we have grace given to us to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbalance them, and to make us to bear up under them. It is an empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical expreſſion, 1 Cor. 10.13. <hi>God will with the temptation make way to eſcape that we may be able to bear it.</hi> Obſerve that expreſſion, <hi>with the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation;</hi> that expreſſion, <hi>with the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,</hi> ſeems to intimate thus much clearly, that the temptation may be lengthned out, that it may be continued for a long time. Yea, but Divine grace ſhall be continued all the while; though the temptation continue, yet Divine grace ſhall not be wanting; there ſhall be <hi>grace</hi> with the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is, grace and <hi>temptation</hi> ſhall run <hi>parallel;</hi> the temptation ſhall laſt no longer than Divine grace is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued and lengthned out to us, Rom. 14.4. <hi>God is able to make him ſtand.</hi> It is ſpoken of ſuch as are <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>infirm</hi> in grace. Now God is able to make them <hi>ſtand,</hi> when we are never ſo weak, and infirm, and impotent in our ſelves, Divine grace is <hi>able</hi> to make us ſtand, and if we have recourſe unto it, <hi>will</hi> make us ſtand.</p>
               <p>Thus I have ſhewn what grace is,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:64024:100"/>and how grace is ſaid to be ſufficient.</p>
               <p>The 3. Particular that is to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to in the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> is this, <hi>what</hi> that grace is that God affords to his people under their conflicts, trials and temptations. <hi>My grace ſhall be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for you.</hi> What is this grace that God affords and communicates to the ſouls of his people when they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der temptations, that I ſhall open to you in three Propoſitions briefly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God gives to them <hi>corroborating</hi> or <hi>ſtrengthning</hi> grace to manage their temptations, and to help them to grapple and conflict with them. It is one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of <hi>Divine grace</hi> to <hi>corroborate</hi> and <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> the ſoul, <hi>ſtrengthned with might by his ſpirit in the inward man,</hi> Eph. 3.16. <hi>Strengthned with all might according to his glorious power,</hi> &amp;c. Col. 1.11. The God of all grace <hi>ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, ſtrengthen,</hi> and <hi>eſtabliſh you,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.10. <hi>The God of all grace;</hi> It is the property of <hi>grace</hi> to <hi>ſtrengthen,</hi> to <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborate</hi> the ſoul. We are inſufficient of our ſelves to reſiſt or withſtand the leaſt temptation. Now this is one <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> of <hi>Divine</hi> grace, that grace inables us to reſiſt, withſtand and repel a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation. Whatever we may think of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:64024:101"/>our ſelves, were it not for the help of Divine grace, we ſhould yield to the firſt touch and impreſſion of a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now Divine grace helps the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of the will, which would ſoon yield, and make no reſiſtance, did not Divine grace fortifie and ſtrengthen it; It is a memorable paſſage of <hi>Auſtin,</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath provided againſt the infirmity of mans will by the help of Divine grace, by which it is ſo acted as not to be turned aſide or overcome; ſo that although it be weak and infirm of it ſelf, yet it ſhall not be overcome by any difficulty.</hi> And that which he farther adds is very remarkable: <hi>So it comes to paſs,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that the weak and infirm will of man, by the ſtrength of Divine grace perſeveres in a little good, whereas the ſound and ſtrong will of the firſt man, did not perſevere in a greater good.</hi> If you conſider it, our firſt Parents when left to themſelves and the liberty of their own will, did not overcome a leſſer temptation. <hi>Adam</hi> when in Paradiſe being left to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his own will, did not by the ſtrength of his own free-will overcome the <hi>firſt</hi> temptation offered to him. But now Divine grace inables them
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:64024:101"/>who are under the power of it, to reſiſt greater temptations. The <hi>firſt Adam</hi> left to the freedom and liberty of his own will, was ſoon overcome by the <hi>firſt temptation</hi> offered to him. The <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that was aſſaulted with all manner of temptations, being corroborated and ſtrengthned by Divine grace was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by <hi>none.</hi> So that we may clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee the power of free-will, and the power of free grace in the <hi>two Adams;</hi> The <hi>firſt Adam</hi> being under the power of his own free-will, was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the firſt temptation. The <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Adam</hi> being under the power of Divine grace overcame all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God gives to his people <hi>ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace,</hi> to keep them from fainting under their temptations. We are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apt to faintings and deſpondencies under our conflicts, Heb. 12.3. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him that indured ſuch contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinners againſt himſelf, leſt ye be weary and faint in your minds. Long afflictions, long exerciſes</hi> and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do diſpoſe us to <hi>fainting</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondencie,</hi> (and experienced ſouls, ſouls trained up under conflicts, know this to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:64024:102"/>be true) yea not only ſo, but they have a far worſe effect ſometimes, they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times diſpoſe the children of God to hard thoughts of God, and repinings againſt God, and to unworthy ſpeeches of God. A ſad inſtance of this we have in very holy men, in <hi>Job</hi> and in the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> though they bore their afflictions a long time, with a great deal of patience and calmneſs, yet having been under their afflictions for ſome time, they brake forth into intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate ſpeeches and <hi>ſore ſits</hi> of <hi>impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> And both the one and the other of them was found <hi>curſing</hi> the <hi>day</hi> of their birth; which ſhews what the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of long trials and exerciſes is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there be Divine grace to ſupport and keep us under them. Now Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace ſo far as it is given to us keeps us from theſe deſpondencies, that we be not tired out with the length of our temptations, Iſa. 41.10. <hi>Fear not, I am with thee, be not diſmaied I am thy God, I will ſtrengthen thee, yea I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteouſneſs.</hi> God <hi>upholds</hi> his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under their temptations by Divine grace, ſo as to keep them from faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under them, Pſal. 27.13. <hi>I had
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:64024:102"/>fainted unleſs I had believed to ſee the goodneſs of the Lord in the Land of the living.</hi> God keeps his people from fainting, by ſtirring up <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> in them, that they may ſee a <hi>gracious Iſſue</hi> of all their afflictions. It is a great relief to the Saints under their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and temptations, to hope that things ſhall end well at laſt; <hi>Though I walk in the midſt of trouble thou wilt revive me,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 138.7. And thus Divine grace helps the Saints and keeps them from fainting, by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alive faith and hope in them, that things ſhall go well with them at laſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And Laſtly, God gives to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>victorious</hi> or <hi>conquering</hi> grace to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to overcome temptations; <hi>Greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.</hi> The grace of God that is in the hearts of the Saints will make them ſuperior to all their tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay,<note place="margin">Objection,</note> doth not experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tell us to the contrary? Do not we ſee many of the Saints of God la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably foiled and worſted by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations? Was not <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> overcome and foiled by
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:64024:103"/>their temptations? How then is it that Divine grace is victorious in the Saints, and makes them overcome their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations?</p>
               <p>To this I Anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note>
               </p>
               <p>That though the Saints of God are foiled by ſome particular temptations, yet Divine grace overcomes in them at laſt. Though <hi>Sampſon</hi> had ſeveral foiles, yet his faith got the victory at laſt; and that appears from hence, that he is put upon record for one of the Worthies of God and eminent in faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. And ſo <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> though they were foiled by temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet they were recovered from their falls by the power of Divine grace. <hi>Davids</hi> repentance, and <hi>Peters</hi> repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance were as eminent as their falls had been. And the fall of the <hi>inceſtuous perſon</hi> in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the defilement that came on the Church by reaſon of it, was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by ſuch an after-work of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, both by the perſon himſelf and the whole Church, as that the Apoſtle ſaith they had approved themſelves to be <hi>clear in that matter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.11. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>pure, chaſt in that matter,</hi> ſo the word ſignifies. So that as the falls of ſome of the Saints
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64024:103"/>have been eminent, ſo their repentance hath been as eminent; Divine grace is victorious in the hearts of the Saints at laſt; though the Saints may receive a foil in particular temptations, yet Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace overcomes at laſt. <hi>To him that overcometh will I give to ſit with me on my throne,</hi> Rev. 3.21. It is by the help of Divine grace that we do overcome. Now the <hi>victoriouſneſs</hi> of Divine grace appears in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The victoriouſneſs of Divine grace appears in this, in inabling the Saints to <hi>perſevere</hi> in the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, 1 Tim. 6.12. <hi>Fight the good fight of Faith;</hi> whilſt a man continues <hi>fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> he is not <hi>overcome.</hi> The Saints are inabled to continue fighting to the laſt. Hence is that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, I have fought a good fight,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.7.</note> 
                  <hi>I have fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Paul</hi> continued fighting to the laſt, and herein doth the victoriouſneſs of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace diſcover it ſelf, that it makes the Saints keep the field, they go on fighting to the laſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>victoriouſneſs</hi> of Divine grace appears in this, in inabling the Saints to <hi>perſevere</hi> in a way of <hi>faith</hi> and obedience to the end, Rev. 2.7.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:64024:104"/>
                  <hi>Be thou faithful to the death.</hi> They could not be ſo, did not Divine grace help them. Rom. 2.7. <hi>To them who by patient continuance in well-doing,</hi> &amp;c. obſerve the expreſſion, <hi>by patient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in well-doing.</hi> The Saints <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoriouſneſs</hi> appears in this, in their <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient continuance in well-doing.</hi> Now it is Divine grace that inables them unto this, Jer. 32.40. <hi>I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> What is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that?<note place="margin">Talis ac tantus trit timor meus, ut mihi perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranter adhaere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                  </note> that is, ſaith <hi>Auſtin, Such and ſo great ſhall that fear of mine be that I will put into their hearts, that they ſhall perſeveringly adhere to me.</hi> Our continuance and perſeverance in obedience, it is as well from Divine grace as the beginnining of it. It is another ſpeech of <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Si in nullo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riandum, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do noſtrum nihil ſit, profecto nec de ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>For as much as we ought to glory in nothing of our own, ſince nothing is our own, we ought not to glory in our moſt perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring obedience.</hi> It is by Divine grace that we perſevere in obedience; the ſame grace that makes us to begin in a way of obedience at firſt, is that that makes us perſevere and continue in a way of obedience to the end.</p>
               <p>Thus I have ſhewn you what that
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:64024:104"/>grace is that God is wont to afford to his people, under their trials, conflicts and temptations.</p>
               <p>The 4. and laſt thing that remains briefly to be ſpoken to in the doctrinal part, is the grounds and reaſons of the point.</p>
               <p>Why is it that <hi>praying ſouls</hi> ſhall have <hi>a fufficiency of grace</hi> to carry them through their <hi>conflicts</hi> and <hi>temptations.</hi> I ſhall touch at the Reaſons very briefly.</p>

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:64024:106"/>magnified in us.

                  <note place="margin">Uſe <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> This point may inform us, that mans <hi>free-will</hi> is not ſufficient of it ſelf, <hi>without Divine grace,</hi> to reſiſt temptation, or indeed to do any thing that is ſpiritually good. This infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence doth naturally ariſe from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, If <hi>Paul</hi> had had a <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of himſelf to have grappled with his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, God needed not have promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his grace to him. But now when God promiſeth that his grace ſhall be ſufficient for <hi>Paul,</hi> that is a certain ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that <hi>Pauls</hi> own ability, and the ſtrength of his own Free-will was not ſufficient of it ſelf, to help him to overcome his temptations without Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace. What need were there
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:64024:106"/>that Gods grace ſhould be promiſed to us, to be ſufficient for us, if our Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will were ſufficient of it ſelf, without Gods grace to carry us through our temptations? This <hi>Idol</hi> of <hi>Free-will</hi> forged by <hi>proud nature,</hi> which would fain retain that <hi>excellency,</hi> which man was only poſſeſt of <hi>before his fall,</hi> is that which hath been adored in the world all along. The <hi>Pelagians</hi> of old held that <hi>free-will</hi> was <hi>untouched, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maimed,</hi> not <hi>hurt</hi> at all, and that mans will was ſufficient of it ſelf, if it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to obey the commands of God. The <hi>Semipelagians</hi> held that free-will was <hi>wounded</hi> indeed and <hi>maimed,</hi> but then it was not <hi>wholly corrupt,</hi> and therefore they attributed mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion partly to grace, and partly to the free-will of man, and ſo divided the matter, <hi>partly</hi> between the <hi>grace</hi> of God, and <hi>partly</hi> between <hi>mans will.</hi> The <hi>Papiſts</hi> in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> condemn this as a great <hi>error</hi> of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that they hold that after the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> free-will is loſt. Now when they are pleaſed to faſten this opinion on the Proteſtants, that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will is loſt; certainly no man was ever ſo abſurd as to imagine that that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:64024:107"/>power or faculty of free-will was loſt. Man hath ſtill his natural fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties left to him ſince his fall.

But that which the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> affirm is this, that ſince the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> the will hath loſt its liberty to that which is ſpiritually good. The <hi>free-will</hi> that they deny is free-will to good, there is no free-will in man ſince the fall to that which is ſpiritually good.

Evil thoughts do naturally proceed from us. But we are beholding unto <hi>Divine grace</hi> for every <hi>holy thought;</hi> and what ſhould this teach us, but to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding humble in our ſelves, and to think meanly of our ſelves?

The whole of the Goſpel (if we underſtand what the Goſpel is) it lies in this, to ſhew us that all our Salvation muſt be from grace, and grace alone.

O that we knew the <hi>excellency</hi> and <hi>ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of <hi>Divine grace!</hi> Fain would I, if I were able, ſet before you a little the <hi>excellency</hi> and <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> of Divine grace, to make my own ſoul and yours more in love with it. There is infinite <hi>beauty, pleaſantneſs, delightfulneſs</hi> and <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> in Divine grace. Thoſe <hi>ſweet</hi> and <hi>freſh</hi> gales that we are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of in the <hi>ſpring ſeaſon</hi> are not ſo ſweet to our ſenſes, as the air and <hi>ſweet gales</hi> of <hi>Divine grace</hi> are to an <hi>holy ſoul,</hi> that hath experience of them. I ſhall inſtance only in one particular at
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:64024:108"/>preſent, to ſhew the ſweetneſs of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace, though in another diſcourſe I ſhall ſet before you more at large the excellency and ſweetneſs of Divine grace. And the <hi>paticular</hi> I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is only this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is all one what condition we are in, if we have but the <hi>gales</hi> of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace,</hi> and are <hi>acted</hi> by Divine grace in every thing. If we be in <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, grace</hi> will make us <hi>ſpiritual</hi> in the uſe of all our <hi>comforts,</hi> grace will <hi>ſhew</hi> us <hi>God</hi> in <hi>every comfort,</hi> grace will cauſe us to <hi>find</hi> out <hi>God</hi> in every thing that we injoy, and lead us to God in every thing. <hi>Grace</hi> will keep us from <hi>ſticking</hi> in the creatures we injoy, and grace will <hi>elevate</hi> us to God by theſe things. So likewiſe, if we be in <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity</hi> and <hi>afflictions, grace</hi> will quiet the ſoul under <hi>afflictions, grace</hi> will cauſe a man to reſt in the <hi>divine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and will;</hi> grace will cauſe a man to be content to be without the things ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath, and to <hi>ſatisfie</hi> himſelf <hi>in God</hi> without theſe things. This is that which made <hi>Paul</hi> to ſay, <hi>He had learnt whatſoever ſtate he was in, therewith to be content: he knew both how to be abaſed, and he knew how to abound:
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:64024:109"/>every where and in all things he was inſtructed both to be full and to be hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, both to abound and ſuffer need: he could do all things through Chriſts ſtrengthning of him,</hi> Phil. 4.11, 12, 13. Divine grace made every condition ſweet to him, thus will Divine grace make every condition ſweet to us, if we have a <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of grace to manage it aright. This ſhould teach us to <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet</hi> and <hi>deſire Divine grace</hi> more than all other things. Truly, we need not be much concerned what our outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is, but our great concernment is to pray that we may have Divine grace to act us in every condition. If we can feel and experiment the <hi>ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> and <hi>operation</hi> of Divine grace, that will carry us through every condition to the glory of God and our own comfort. We are <hi>expecting times</hi> of trouble, and I fear there is too great cauſe for us to expect them: but let us not be ſo much <hi>ſolicitous</hi> what may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall us, what difficulties we may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed withal, as we are <hi>ſolicitous</hi> to get Divine grace.

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:64024:109"/>may be, Divine grace will carry us through them all.</p>
               <p>I ſhall add no more at preſent, but in another diſcourſe I ſhall inlarge far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on this ſubject, to ſhew the <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency</hi> and <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> of Divine grace.</p>

                  <hi>but to put them off altogether it is impoſſible; our own heart, our own thoughts are not in our own power.</hi> How often doth ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience evidence this to be true?

But now Divine grace in the <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> overcame all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations: So that by comparing the two <hi>Adams</hi> together, the firſt and the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> we may ſee the plain difference between the vertue or power of free-will, and the vertue and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Divine grace. <hi>Free-will</hi> in the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> was overcome by the firſt <hi>temptation,</hi> Divine grace in <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> overcame all temptations. So that if we would be ſuperior to all temptations, we muſt be ſure to ſubject our ſelves to that grace that raigns in

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:64024:113"/>that which doth <hi>facilitate</hi> the acts of obedience. Grace makes a man to act with <hi>eaſe</hi> and <hi>facility</hi> in the ways of God: and whereas without divine grace, every act of obedience would not only be hard but impoſſible, by the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> and <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> of Divine grace, the acts of obedience are made <hi>facile</hi> and <hi>eaſie.</hi> The <hi>moral Philoſophers</hi> ſay of habits, that they do <hi>facilitate</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> to act, and render the <hi>faculty</hi> more apt and ready for action.

The reaſon why holy duties ſeem <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>difficult</hi> to us, and the reaſon why we do not know how to <hi>wade</hi> through them, it is becauſe we have no more experience of Divine grace.

                  </note> conſider, it is <hi>actual grace</hi> that quickens and excites habitual grace. Although we have the habits of grace in us; yet we cannot exert and put forth theſe habits into act without actual grace, John 15.5. <hi>without me ye can do nothing.</hi> Believers, that are in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that have the habits of grace, cannot perform any act of obedience without actual grace and preſent influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from Chriſt. <hi>Awake O North wind, come thou South, blow upon my garden, that the ſpices thereof may flow out,</hi> Cant. 4.16. The Saints graces which are here compared to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they will not be in exerciſe and ſo yield a pleaſant fragrant ſavour, unleſs there be freſh gales of the ſpirit to blow upon them.

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:64024:115"/>of corruption? What is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this difference, but that at one time we have the aſſiſtance of Divine grace; and God leaves us at another time to our ſelves, but for our humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is <hi>Divine grace</hi> that doth <hi>reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> and <hi>reſtore</hi> us after our <hi>relapſes</hi> and falls into ſin.<note place="margin">Conſid. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> As it is <hi>Divine grace</hi> that <hi>prevents</hi> and <hi>keeps</hi> us from falling, ſo far as we are kept from falling; ſo it is Divine grace that recovers us out of our falls.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is <hi>Divine grace</hi> that keeps us <hi>from falling</hi> into ſin, ſo far as we are kept, Jude 24. <hi>To him that is able to keep you from falling.</hi> We ſhould fall <hi>foully,</hi> we ſhould fall <hi>ſcandalouſly,</hi> did not Divine grace keep us. Oh, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us to love Divine grace great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. There is not the holieſt perſon that could keep himſelf from falling into a groſs and ſcandalous ſin, did not Divine grace keep him. Some of the Saints have fallen into foul and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ſins, <hi>David</hi> did ſo, and others of the Saints have done ſo, and did not <hi>Divine</hi> grace keep us we ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly do as they have done. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour bids us pray, <hi>Lead us not into
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:64024:115"/>temptation, but deliver us from evil,</hi> and what is the meaning of thoſe two Petitions, but that we might have grace to keep us from temptation, and grace to deliver us from evil. Now if we ought to pray to be delivered from evil, certainly we cannot keep our ſelves from the <hi>evil of ſin</hi> without the power of Divine grace, therefore if we are kept from the <hi>like falls,</hi> wherewith others are overtaken, <hi>let us not be high-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but fear,</hi> let us remember that it is <hi>by grace</hi> that we ſtand.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As Divine grace keeps us from falling ſo far as we are kept, ſo it is Divine grace that recovers us out of our falls. We ſhould remain long enough under our falls did not Divine grace raiſe us up, and recover us out of them. It is conceived by Divines, that <hi>David</hi> did continue ſome time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his fall before he was recovered out of it. Look as when God leaves us to our ſelves firſt of all, our own hearts will hurry us to the greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitancies; ſo if God continue to leave us to our ſelves, we ſhall pine and languiſh under our diſtempers, our own corruptions will <hi>tumultuate</hi> more and more. For though corruption can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:64024:116"/>not <hi>reign</hi> in a godly man as it doth in a wicked man, (it is inconſiſtent with grace for ſin to reign in any that have grace) yet it may <hi>rage</hi> in him for a time, and <hi>Luther</hi> hath a ſaying to this purpoſe, That ſin may <hi>rage</hi> in a godly man for a time more than in a wicked man. Oh, but how very ſad and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is it where God permits and ſuffers corruption thus to tumultuate and rage in us? Truly till Divine grace do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover us, corruption will have its ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging fits. It is Divine grace that doth recover us. He reſtoreth my ſoul, ſaith <hi>David.</hi> Oh, until Divine grace do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore us, it will be long enough till we reſtore our ſelves, nay we ſhall never be reſtored. Not that we are to ſit ſtill, but the more we find corruption to rage, the more ought we to groan to Heaven, and cry out ſo much the louder for Divine grace: but this is certain, till Divine grace recover us, we ſhall never be recovered. When <hi>Peter</hi> was left to himſelf, left by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace, he denied his Maſter the firſt, ſecond and third time, and there was no ſign of his recovery, till <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave him a look with his eye. It muſt be ſome powerful touch of Divine
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:64024:116"/>grace that muſt recover us when we are fallen by corruption and temptation.</p>

                  <hi>enlivens</hi> and raiſes the affections after they have been flat and dead. Holy men, perſons that have walked with God, do often complain of <hi>damps</hi> and <hi>deadneſſes</hi> that they feel coming upon themſelves. It is not ſo with them as ſometimes it hath been with them. They do not feel that <hi>fervency</hi> in prayer, that <hi>live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> in holy duties, that <hi>activity</hi> for God, thoſe meltíngs in their <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> as ſometimes they have found. Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there is great liſtleſneſs to holy duties, much coldneſs and deadneſs in their hearts, much ſtreightneſs in their affections in their performance of holy duties. <hi>David</hi> prays in Pſal. 119. <hi>Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold me that I may live,</hi> that was an argument that he was ſenſible that his <hi>ſpiritual life</hi> was greatly decayed, that he was grown dead, and heavy, and lumpiſh in the ways of God; that he had loſt that quickneſs and livelineſs of his affections that once he had. Thus is it with others of the people of God, they find deadneſs, coldneſs, lumpiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs too often coming upon them, and the <hi>cauſe</hi> of this ſpiritual deadneſs is
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:64024:117"/>commonly one of theſe things, either, 1. <hi>Unthankfulneſs</hi> for former quicknings, or elſe, 2. Preſumption of our ſelves, and our own ſtrength, and thinking that we had <hi>quickning</hi> and <hi>inlargement</hi> at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Or elſe, 3. Neglect of ſome of the means of grace publick or private. Or elſe, 4. Some <hi>inordinate affection</hi> ſpringing up in the ſoul. Or elſe, 5. Some ſecret indulgence to ſome ſin that grieves the Spirit, and cauſeth the Spirit to withdraw from us. Theſe are ordinarily the cauſes of thoſe <hi>deadneſſes</hi> that fall upon the Saints. Now when the Saints fall under theſe deadneſſes, it is Divine grace muſt quicken them; they cannot raiſe themſelves from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe deadneſſes, they cannot get from under them. We may think to <hi>riſe</hi> and <hi>ſhake</hi> our ſelves, and do as at other times; but believe it, if the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God be departed from us, as from <hi>Sampſon,</hi> we ſhall fall flat to the ground: as a man that is <hi>wounded,</hi> may eſſay to riſe up and to walk, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently falls down to the earth again. But now Divine grace, that puts new life and ſtrength into the ſoul; a freſh gale of the Spirit elevates and raiſes a dead ſoul. Look as a <hi>ſhip</hi> when it is
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:64024:117"/>becalmed, and there is no <hi>wind</hi> ſtirring; can make no way, but then a <hi>freſh gale comes,</hi> and then it ſails amain. So when a ſoul hath received a <hi>freſh gale</hi> of <hi>Divine grace,</hi> then it begins to move afreſh, then it can act afreſh, whereas before it was becalmed and found lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſtirring, little motion Godward. <hi>Draw me,</hi> ſaith the Church, and then <hi>we will run after thee,</hi> Cant. 1.4.</p>

                  </note> that it <hi>elevates</hi> a man <hi>above the world.</hi> What is it that makes ſome of the Saints to <hi>contemn</hi> the world when others do ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire it? it is the the power of Divine grace that <hi>elevates</hi> and <hi>raiſeth</hi> their hearts above the world. It is grace that makes the world ſeem a little thing.

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:64024:118"/>Other men admire the world and purſue it as their <hi>chief</hi> good; but now a man that is acted by Divine grace doth not ſo, he hath no ſuch <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring thoughts</hi> of it, he doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend ſo <hi>much good,</hi> ſo much <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency</hi> in it, but his heart is carried out to ſomething higher.</p>

                  </note> it enables a man to <hi>bear afflictions,</hi> grace <hi>quiets</hi> the ſoul under affliction, and ſtrengthens it to bear up with patience under it, 1 Col. 7. <hi>Strengthned unto all patience.</hi> It is <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace</hi> that ſtrengthens us to bear af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions with patience, we ſhould <hi>ſink</hi> and <hi>ſuccumb,</hi> and <hi>deſpond,</hi> did not Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace ſtrengthen us to bear up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affliction, Iſa. 40. laſt. <hi>He giveth power to the faint, and to them that have no might he increaſeth ſtrength.</hi> Truly, a little affliction will ſink us if Divine grace do not help us; whereas on the other hand, a great affliction will not be able to bear us down, if Divine grace do but ſupport us. If a man have a great preſence and aſſiſtance of Divine grace, it will help him to bear a long courſe, and tract, and ſeries of affliction. If one affliction come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the neck of another, yet if he have
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:64024:118"/>Divine grace continued to him, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace will enable him to bear all. <hi>Job</hi> had one affliction come upon the neck of another, and yet he faith, <hi>The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi> Indeed when he was left <hi>to himſelf,</hi> then he <hi>curſed the day of his birth,</hi> but as long as <hi>Divine grace</hi> was with him he bare one affliction after another. When the Lord leaves us to our ſelves, then we ſhall find ſecret murmurings and repinings in our hearts againſt the providence of God, and God leaves us ſometimes on purpoſe to our ſelves to ſhew us what is in our own hearts. If Divine grace be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, then we have experience how apt our hearts are to repine, and to be impatient under affliction; but when Divine grace is preſent with us, then we can lie down ſweetly under the hand of God and acquieſce in his wiſdom and will, believing that every thing that comes upon us is beſt for us, as he ſaid, <hi>I was dumb and opened not my mouth, becauſe thou diſt it.</hi>

There is nothing in this world we can be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of, the <hi>greateſt, higheſt</hi> and <hi>beſt</hi> things of this world are ſubject to change. But if we know that our ſins are pardoned, if we know that we have an intereſt in the love and favour of God, if we know that our ſouls ſhall be ſaved at laſt, here we have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is <hi>certain</hi> to quiet and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us. And let me be bold to ſay, it will never be well with us till we are brought to this, to reſolve all our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs into the ſalvation of our ſouls at laſt, I ſay till we do this we ſhall never be at reſt, 1 Pet. 1.10. <hi>Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the end of your hope, the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your ſoul.</hi> Until the thoughts of ſalvation <hi>preponderate</hi> the ſufferings of this life, till we are able in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to relieve our ſelves with this <hi>one thought,</hi> whatever my afflictions are, I hope I ſhall be ſaved at laſt, ſalvation is mine and I hope I ſhall live with God for ever, it will never be well with us, for afflictions and trials will come whether we expect them yea or
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:64024:121"/>no, and if one affliction be blown over we muſt expect another. When therefore afflictions and trials come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, if we have nothing to ſtay, bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance and quiet the heart, we muſt needs ſink under them. Now nothing will bear up our hearts but the hope of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; let us therefore live upon the hope of Salvation; there is nothing like to the ſolid aſſurance and hope of ſalvation in the next life, that will bear us up under the various changes of this life. Oh let us be making ſure of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that will be our greateſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſupport amidſt all the changes we may meet with here beneath.</p>

               <p>THere are ſeveral other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars that diſcover to us the <hi>excellency</hi> of <hi>Divine grace,</hi> and you muſt carry this all along with you, that I am not now ſpeaking of that which <hi>Divines</hi> call <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual grace,</hi> but I am ſpeaking of the excellency of the <hi>influence</hi> of <hi>Divine grace,</hi> or that which is commonly called <hi>actual</hi> grace. Now I ſhall propound ſeveral things more concerning the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of grace,</hi> over and above what I have already ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>The 1. Particular is this, It is by the help of <hi>Divine grace</hi> that we come to apprehend the reality, the <hi>nature,</hi> the <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>excellency</hi> of ſpiritual things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is <hi>grace</hi> that helps us to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:64024:122"/>the <hi>reality of ſpiritual things.</hi> Carnal men that are <hi>deſtitute</hi> of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace,</hi> hear of the <hi>things of God,</hi> but they are only <hi>general notions,</hi> ſwimming in their brain. Carnal men may hear of Heaven, and Hell, they may hear of the <hi>preciouſneſs</hi> of the <hi>ſoul,</hi> they may hear of the <hi>excellency</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the like: but they are not acquainted with the reality of theſe things; they have indeed ſome general confuſed notions of theſe things, but theſe things are not repreſented to the mind of carnal men as real things. Now here is one diſcovery of the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi> of <hi>Divine grace.</hi> Divine grace diſcovers to the ſoul the <hi>reality</hi> of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, it cauſeth a man to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what is ſpoken concerning God to be real, it cauſeth a man to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that <hi>Heaven</hi> and the <hi>glory of it</hi> is a <hi>real thing,</hi> and that the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Chriſt is a <hi>real</hi> thing, Heb. 11.1. <hi>Faith is the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> Faith cauſeth things that have a <hi>real being</hi> in themſelves, to have a <hi>real be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>exiſtence</hi> in a mans apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Faith makes things to be clear, and plain, and evident to the ſoul. Thoſe things that are dark, obſcure
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:64024:122"/>and uncertain to carnal men, that have no grace, theſe things appear with clearneſs and evidence to a man that hath Divine grace. It is ſaid of the antient Saints, that, <hi>They were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the promiſes,</hi> Heb. 11.13. That is, they were fully perſwaded of the <hi>verity, truth,</hi> and <hi>certainty</hi> of the promiſes. Other men have only ſome <hi>fluctuating, wavering, uncertain</hi> thoughts of ſpiritual things, but they are not poſſeſt with the truth and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of them. It is <hi>Divine grace</hi> only that cauſeth ſpiritual things to appear to be <hi>real</hi> to the mind and apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is <hi>Divine grace</hi> that cauſeth a man to apprehend the <hi>nature</hi> of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things. Other men hear of God, and Chriſt, and the myſteries of the Goſpel, but it is little they apprehend of the nature of theſe things, 1 Cor. 2.14. <hi>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the ſpirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually diſcerned.</hi> A man that hath not grace doth not know, neither can he know ſpiritual things. There muſt be a <hi>ſpiritual light</hi> let into the mind,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:64024:123"/>to cauſe a man to apprehend the nature of ſpiritual things, otherwiſe he cannot underſtand them, becauſe as the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>they are ſpiritually diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Now men that have no grace, they are deſtitute of this <hi>light,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſhould apprehend <hi>ſpiritual things.</hi> But now Divine grace, that gives a <hi>ſpiritual apprehenſion</hi> of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al things. <hi>To you it is given to know the myſteries of the Kingdom,</hi> Matth. 13.11. It is a ſpicial gift of God, to be acquainted with the nature of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, for theſe things are <hi>rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles</hi> to other men. A carnal man knows the <hi>outſide</hi> of things, but he is not led into the inſide of truth; as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks concerning the Law, Heb. 10.1. <hi>That the Law had a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of things to come, but it had not the very image of the things themſelves.</hi> So we may ſay a carnal man, a man that is not <hi>illuminated</hi> by the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>Divine grace,</hi> ſuch a man may have a <hi>ſhadow</hi> of the knowledge of things in his mind, he may have the <hi>form of knowledge</hi> in his mind, but he hath not <hi>the very image</hi> and <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of things in his mind. But now <hi>Divine grace</hi> makes ſpiritual things appear in ſome
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:64024:123"/>meaſure as they are. By the help of Divine grace we are helped to ſee ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things <hi>as they are,</hi> hence is that of the <hi>Apoſtle, you received it not as the word of man, but as it is in truth the word of God,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2.13. Other men receive the word, as the word of men; O but grace makes a man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the word <hi>as the word of God,</hi> it diſcovers to him the nature of the word, that it comes from God, and hath a Divine ſtamp and impreſs upon it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Grace cauſeth a man to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the <hi>excellency</hi> of ſpiritual things. As Divine grace helps a man to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the <hi>reality</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al things,</hi> ſo it cauſeth a man to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the <hi>excellency</hi> of ſpiritual things, 1 Cor. 2.6. <hi>We ſpeak wiſdom among them that are perfect.</hi> By <hi>perfect</hi> here the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> doth not underſtand ſuch as are <hi>ſimply</hi> and <hi>abſolutely</hi> perfect, for there are none ſuch in this world: But he means <hi>comparatively</hi> perfect, <hi>We ſpeak wiſdom among them that are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> that is, ſuch as are <hi>perfect</hi> in compariſon of other men, <hi>We ſpeak wiſdom to them that are perfect,</hi> that is, unto <hi>enlightned ſouls.</hi> We ſpeak wiſdom to them that are endowed with
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:64024:124"/>
                  <hi>grace</hi> and the Spirit of God. I ſuppoſe the Apoſtle by <hi>perfect</hi> here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands <hi>illuminated</hi> ſouls, ſuch as are il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated by grace and the Spirit of God. Now, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>We ſpeak wiſdom to them.</hi> The <hi>Goſpel</hi> and the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of it, is the greateſt and higheſt wiſdom to illuminated ſouls, to ſuch as are enlightned by the Spirit of God; however they may appear <hi>fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to other men who are not enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yet there is no ſuch wiſdom to an enlightned ſoul, as there is in the <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries</hi> of Chriſt. The <hi>conjunction</hi> of the <hi>two natures</hi> in the <hi>perſon</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>myſterie</hi> of Divine grace in carrying on the work of our Salvation by Chriſt in both his natures, this is the greateſt wiſdom to an enlightned ſoul. <hi>We ſpeak wiſdom to them that are perfect,</hi> this is the wiſdom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks of, <hi>viz.</hi> The myſterie of Chriſt, the myſterie of our ſalvation carried on by Chriſt, this is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt wiſdom to an enlightned ſoul. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace makes a man to ſee the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of ſpiritual things. An <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned ſoul</hi> ſeeth the worth of <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> of ſin, the worth of Gods favour, the <hi>beauty</hi> of <hi>holineſs,</hi> the <hi>preciouſneſs</hi>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:64024:124"/>of the <hi>promiſes;</hi> whereas other men ſee no great excellency in theſe things. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath it entred into the heart of man, to conceive the things that God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them to us by the ſpirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.9, 10. The Spirit of God reveals the <hi>excellency</hi> of thoſe things to the children of God, that other men ſee no excellency in.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond particular to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the excellency of Divine grace is this, It is <hi>Divine</hi> grace that <hi>elevates the ſoul to God.</hi> Naturally we ſtick in theſe lower and inſerior things. Now this is the nature of grace,<note place="margin">Tiah't crcatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram rationalem ſupra conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem naturae ad participationem Boni Divini.</note> that it doth advance the reaſonable creature above the condition and <hi>ſphere</hi> of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, unto the participation of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine good. Nature</hi> ſticks in <hi>natural</hi> good, nature reſts in <hi>natural things,</hi> but grace carries up the ſoul to a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural good, grace carries up the ſoul above all created things unto God himſelf. This is a great thing that doth commend Divine grace to us, that it is grace only that elevates the ſoul above the creature unto God. Were it not for Divine grace, we
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:64024:125"/>ſhould always ſtick in the creature. It is grace that elevates and raiſeth the ſoul above the creature unto God. Without Divine grace we can riſe no <hi>higher</hi> than the creature. Every natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man <hi>ſeeks</hi> his happineſs in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, <hi>ſticks</hi> there, and riſeth no higher. But this is the excellency of grace, that it elevates and advanceth the ſoul to God himſelf, <hi>To thee O Lord do I lift up my ſoul,</hi> Pſal. 25.1. Grace raiſeth up the ſoul above <hi>created things</hi> unto God. By the power of Divine grace we are elevated to that <hi>life</hi> which is above nature. Grace carries us above the <hi>ſphere</hi> of <hi>nature.</hi> By the power of Divine grace it is that we come to <hi>know God,</hi> to love him, to <hi>converſe</hi> with him,<note place="margin">John 17.3.</note> and this is <hi>life eternal to know the only true God.</hi> We may <hi>eat,</hi> and <hi>drink,</hi> and <hi>walk</hi> up and down in the world, but this is not <hi>eternal life,</hi> theſe are the actions of a <hi>natural</hi> life which muſt have an end: Alſo we may <hi>buy,</hi> and <hi>ſell,</hi> and commerce in the world, but theſe are the actions of a <hi>civil</hi> life, and theſe things muſt have an end, they muſt end with this world. But to know God, to love him, to <hi>ſeek</hi> his glory, theſe are the actions of a
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:64024:125"/>ſpiritual life, and theſe are the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi> of eternal life. So that <hi>grace,</hi> it carries a man above the <hi>whole ſphere</hi> of nature. Without grace you can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do as other men do, you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the actions of a natural life, thoſe things that concern this world, but you cannot do thoſe things that concern the ſpiritual life. It is grace only that ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates and raiſeth up the ſoul to God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To ſhew the excellency of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace,</hi> conſider, There is <hi>infinite ſweetneſs</hi> in <hi>Divine</hi> grace. O the <hi>ſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi> the <hi>unutterable ſweetneſs</hi> that is in <hi>Divine</hi> grace! I dare appeal to the experience of holy ſouls, whether ever they found any thing ſo <hi>ſweet</hi> to them in this world as <hi>Divine grace,</hi> and the actings of it in their ſouls. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo ſweet as Divine grace. And here I ſhall ſet before you in ſome particulars the ſweetneſs of Divine grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider, That Divine grace carrying up the ſoul to God, as it doth, it carries it up to the <hi>higheſt object. Grace</hi> cauſeth the ſoul to <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend</hi> and go beyond the ſphere of all created things and to fix in God alone. Now when the ſoul is brought to God,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:64024:126"/>there is not a <hi>higher</hi> or more ſuperior object for the ſoul to aſcend unto. Now when the ſoul by the power of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace is brought to him who is the <hi>higheſt perfection,</hi> beyond whom there is not a <hi>higher perfection;</hi> this muſt needs cauſe <hi>infinite ſweetneſs,</hi> for the ſoul is ſtill <hi>climbing</hi> up from one thing to another, it is <hi>aſcending</hi> higher and higher, it would fain be at the top of all good. I ſay it is in the nature of our ſouls to aim at this. But now when the ſoul hath found out the <hi>higheſt perfection, him</hi> that is <hi>perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> it ſelf, this muſt needs be matter of infinite ſweetneſs to it; when the ſoul hath found out <hi>that good,</hi> than whom there is no higher, greater or better, but is abſolutely perfect and compleat, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that muſt needs afford the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> and <hi>contentment</hi> to it.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the <hi>ſeveral</hi> ends men aim at, and the <hi>ſeveral</hi> goods that they purſue, there is always one <hi>laſt</hi> end, one <hi>chief good,</hi> and when they acquire the <hi>laſt</hi> end, and obtain the chief good, that is their greateſt delight. Now God is the <hi>laſt</hi> end, the <hi>chief</hi> good, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is <hi>beyond</hi> him, nothing may be <hi>compared</hi> with him. Now Divine
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:64024:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>grace elevating the ſoul to God, muſt needs fill it with infinite ſweetneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſweetneſs of Divine grace appears in this; <hi>grace,</hi> in carrying forth the ſoul to God, carries it forth to the moſt <hi>ſutable</hi> and <hi>convenient object. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi> ariſeth from <hi>ſuitableneſs</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency.</hi> Now grace elevating the ſoul to God, elevates it to the moſt <hi>ſuitable</hi> object. The ſoul being of a <hi>ſpiritual nature,</hi> a <hi>ſpiritual good</hi> is moſt ſuitable to it; the ſoul being <hi>immortal,</hi> an <hi>eternal</hi> good is moſt ſuitable to it; the ſoul being ſo a <hi>vaſt</hi> capacity as that it can take in more than all created things come to, an <hi>infinite</hi> and an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created</hi> good is moſt ſuitable to it. Now Divine grace is that which ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates the ſoul to God who is a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, eternal, infinite good, and this is the moſt <hi>ſuitable</hi> and <hi>convenient object</hi> for the ſoul, and therefore when the ſoul by <hi>Divine</hi> grace is <hi>carried</hi> up to <hi>God,</hi> it muſt needs fill it with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſweetneſs, becauſe no object ſo ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and <hi>convenient</hi> to the ſoul, as God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another thing, to ſhew the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Divine grace is this, That Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace raiſeth the ſoul to an holy
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:64024:127"/>kind of <hi>amplitude</hi> and <hi>greatneſs.</hi> I remember <hi>Gibeuf</hi> obſerves that the true <hi>liberty</hi> of the will it doſt conſiſt <hi>in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vina quadam amplitudine,</hi> in a <hi>divine</hi> kind of <hi>amplitude</hi> or <hi>greatneſs</hi> of ſoul, that is to ſay, when the ſoul is carried up above the ſphere of created things to <hi>love</hi> God and to <hi>adhere</hi> to him as the chief good, this is the true liberty of the will as he ſtates it. Now it is <hi>Divine grace</hi> that raiſeth the ſoul to this <hi>amplitude</hi> and <hi>holy greatneſs.</hi> Grace is that which <hi>raiſeth</hi> the ſoul up to God, and when the ſoul by the power of <hi>Divine grace</hi> is raiſed up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, then it hath a <hi>large field</hi> to expatiate it ſelf, and walk in. The more the ſoul is acted by <hi>Divine grace,</hi> the more <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>inlargement</hi> doth it find in it ſelf, Pſal. 111.45. <hi>I will walk at liberty, for I ſeek thy precepts.</hi> As much as if he ſhould ſay, I find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that gives that <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement</hi> to my ſoul like to the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> like to holy walking. When <hi>Divine grace</hi> raiſeth the ſoul to walk with God in a way of <hi>obedience,</hi> this is that gives the greateſt liberty and inlargement to the ſoul. If we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, we ſhall find it true, <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:64024:127"/>things,</hi> when the ſoul is let out to them in an inordinate way, do but <hi>confine</hi> and <hi>narrow</hi> the ſoul, the ſoul is as it were <hi>pent up</hi> in a narrow place, when it is confined to theſe things. But when grace raiſeth the ſoul to God, then the ſoul finds it ſelf at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, the ſoul never <hi>enjoys</hi> it ſelf ſo much as when it loves <hi>God</hi> moſt, when it adheres to God moſt, when it <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights</hi> in him moſt. Here the ſoul finds Sea-room enough, when the ſoul adheres to God, ſolaces it ſelf in God, then it is in a vaſt <hi>Ocean</hi> of good. But when the ſoul adheres to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is kept within narrow bounds and limits. The creature is but a <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, narrow, private, particular</hi> good, indeed it is not worth the name of good if it be conſidered abſtract from God and its relation to him. But now God is the <hi>univerſal good,</hi> and by grace it is we are elevated to God the <hi>univerſal good.</hi> There is an <hi>innate propenſion</hi> in the ſoul, carrying it out (if I may ſo ſay) to an <hi>infinite good.</hi> Indeed this is the unhappineſs of men by the <hi>fall,</hi> they have loſt the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>true good.</hi> Man by the fall hath loſt the knowledge of God,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:64024:128"/>and love to him, and man having loſt the <hi>Creator,</hi> and being ſunk into the creature, there we ſtick, till Divine grace elevate us, and take us out of the creature, and bring us back to God again. But though it be thus with man by the fall, that he hath loſt the <hi>knowledge</hi> of God (the only <hi>true good,</hi> the <hi>chief good,</hi> the <hi>infinite good</hi>) and <hi>love</hi> to him, yet there is a <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inclination</hi> in the ſoul (if I may ſo ſpeak) towards the chief good, that is to ſay, the ſoul of man would fain be at the <hi>higheſt good</hi> if it knew how to come at it, and this is intrinſecal to the nature of the ſoul, and the <hi>Radix</hi> of liberty lies in it, that the ſoul would fain come up to the chief good, if it knew how. Now theſe <hi>lower</hi> and <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> goods detain and keep back the ſoul from God the <hi>chief good,</hi> whilſt the ſoul is in a <hi>tendency</hi> towards <hi>good</hi> (as it always is and cannot but be, the reaſonable ſoul is always in a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy towards ſome good or other). It is hindred from aſcending unto God the chief good, by adhering to theſe <hi>lower</hi> and <hi>inferior</hi> goods, and thus it is <hi>nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed</hi> and confined; whereas if it could reach to God, there it would find <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:64024:128"/>and <hi>inlargement</hi> by ſeeing an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite good before it. Now herein doth the excellency of Divine grace appear, in that it cauſeth the ſoul to extend it ſelf and reach forth it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God the <hi>infinite good;</hi> and whilſt the ſoul is thus carried forth in a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect line</hi> of affection towards God the <hi>infinite</hi> good, then it finds the greateſt <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>inlargement in it ſelf.</hi> This is another that ſpeaks the ſweetneſs of Divine grace, that it fills the ſoul with an holy amplitude or greatneſs, and delivers it from confinement.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſweetneſs of Divine grace appears in this, grace cauſeth the ſoul to act <hi>regularly,</hi> and in the moſt <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect manner.</hi> The more <hi>regular</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> the <hi>operations</hi> of the ſoul are, the more <hi>true peace.</hi> You will find it in <hi>experience,</hi> that all the troubles and diſturbance of the ſoul comes from the <hi>oblique</hi> and <hi>irregular motions</hi> of the ſoul; the more regularly your ſouls move and act, the more peace, Pſal. 119.165. <hi>Great peace have they that love thy law, and nothing ſhall offend them. The law of God</hi> is nothing but the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi> or <hi>declaration</hi> of his <hi>will,</hi> now the <hi>will</hi> of God is the <hi>rule</hi> of <hi>goodneſs.</hi>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:64024:129"/>Now Divine grace is that which ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates the ſoul to act moſt <hi>regularly,</hi> and <hi>conformably</hi> to the Divine will, which is the rule of goodneſs, and <hi>perfection,</hi> and the greater <hi>harmony</hi> there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our will and the <hi>Divine will,</hi> the more true peace. Look as it is with the body, when all the parts of the body are kept in their proper place; when none of the limbs are diſlocated, and disjoynted, when the humours are kept in a due temperament, when the ſenſes are kept quick and lively, and fit to diſcharge their office, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their operations, the body is then in the moſt perfect health, and injoyes it ſelf moſt. So it is here, when all things are in order in the ſoul, when the ſoul acts moſt regularly and conformably to the Divine will, then doth the ſoul injoy it ſelf moſt. The <hi>perfection</hi> of every thing, it is to be in the place God hath ſet it in. Now the perfection of man who is a <hi>reaſonable creature,</hi> it is to be in a ſtate of ſubjection to God. Man as he is a reaſonable creature being created <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a law,</hi> mans perfection is to be ſubject to the <hi>Divine law,</hi> and the greater his conformity is to that Law,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:64024:129"/>the greater is his perfection, and the reaſon is, as was ſaid, becauſe man by obſerving the Divine law, keeps in the place God hath ſet him in. Man as he is a creature is in a ſtate of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and his perfection is to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his Creator, and the more he is ſo, the more he doth attain the end of his creation, and ſo by conſequence the more <hi>true peace</hi> doth he injoy.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The ſweetneſs of Divine grace ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in this, that Divine grace cauſeth a man to <hi>delight in</hi> the <hi>ways of God, Bleſſed is the man that feareth the Lord, that delighteth greatly in his commandments.</hi> So much grace, ſo much delight in the ways of God. A man may walk in the ways of God, yet not find ſo much delight in them at firſt. But ſo much as a man hath of Divine grace, the more ſhall he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the ways of God; and the more a man can delight in Gods ways, the greater is the <hi>meaſure</hi> of his grace. Now it is Divine grace that cauſeth a man to delight in the ways of God: now delight cauſeth ſweetneſs; ſo much as we can delight in the ways of God, ſo much ſweetneſs ſhall we find in them: and the reaſon why we find no more
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:64024:130"/>ſweetneſs in the ways of God, is becauſe we delight no more in them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> of Divine grace appears in this, that the <hi>preſence</hi> of <hi>Divine grace</hi> ſweetnes the want of other comforts.<note place="margin">Prov. 14.14.</note> 
                  <hi>A good man,</hi> ſaith <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, is ſatisfied from himſelf. A holy man</hi> that wants other comforts, ſo far as he is acted by <hi>Divine</hi> grace, finds a great deal of <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> in the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of grace it ſelf; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he finds no more <hi>ſweetneſs,</hi> is becauſe he hath no more grace. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more <hi>ſweet</hi> to an <hi>holy ſoul,</hi> than to love God, and be beloved of him, <hi>In the keeping of his commandments there is great reward,</hi> Pſal. 19.11. not only <hi>after</hi> the <hi>keeping</hi> of them, but <hi>in</hi> the <hi>keeping</hi> of them there is <hi>great reward.</hi> So much as <hi>Divine grace</hi> acts us, we ſhall be <hi>ſatisfied in God</hi> and <hi>with God</hi> himſelf, when God denies us other things. Not but that we may lawfully <hi>deſire</hi> and <hi>uſe</hi> other things, ſo far as God allows and gives us theſe things. But when God denies us theſe things, it is the property of Divine grace to incline the ſoul to take up with God, and to ſatisfie it ſelf with God, when God withholds theſe things
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:64024:130"/>from us, as I may ſhew more hereafter.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> of Divine grace appears in this, that grace cauſeth a man to <hi>live</hi> upon God himſelf <hi>in the midſt</hi> of other comforts. As it is the nature of Divine grace to cauſe a man to <hi>retire</hi> to God, and <hi>cleave</hi> to him when he wants other things; ſo it is grace that cauſeth the ſoul to <hi>live</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God himſelf in the midſt of other comforts. When a man is <hi>ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> with all other comforts, grace cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the ſoul to turn it ſelf to God and ſay, <hi>thou art my happineſs, thou ſhalt be my happineſs, and not theſe things,</hi> this is the proper language of grace. I take it for a certain truth, that it is the property of grace to ſuffer the ſoul to <hi>reſt</hi> in nothing but in God himſelf. Grace cauſeth a man to paſs through all his other comforts, and injoyments, unto God, and ſay, Thou art the <hi>true reſt,</hi> the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſolace</hi> of my ſoul. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>is,</hi> nothing <hi>can be,</hi> nothing <hi>ſhall be</hi> that to my ſoul which thou art. It is <hi>Divine</hi> grace that thus <hi>elevateth</hi> the ſoul to God. <hi>Carnal men</hi> that are not <hi>acted by Divine</hi> grace, <hi>ſtick</hi> and <hi>reſt</hi> in the <hi>outward</hi> things themſelves that they injoy. It is <hi>Divine</hi> grace on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:64024:131"/>that cauſeth a man to live upon God in the midſt of other things, and to <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace</hi> himſelf in him over and above all the other comforts that he doth injoy, <hi>Thou art my portion, ſaith my ſoul,</hi> Lam. 3.24. And it is a great Scripture, Pſal. 142.5. <hi>Thou art my refuge, and my portion in the land of the living.</hi> Why in the land of the living? What is the meaning of that, that the Lord is his portion <hi>in the land of the living?</hi> The <hi>land</hi> of the <hi>living,</hi> is this <hi>preſent</hi> world, ſo it is taken in ſeveral Scriptures,<note place="margin">Iſa. 38.11.</note> 
                  <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſaid, <hi>He ſhould not ſee the Lord, even the Lord in the land of the living.</hi> So it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>That he was cut off from the land of the living;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 53.8. Pſal. 27.13.</note> ſo again, <hi>I had fainted unleſs I had believed to ſee the goodneſs of the Lord in the land of the living:</hi> ſo that the land of the <hi>living,</hi> is taken for <hi>this world.</hi> Now, ſaith <hi>David, Thou art my refuge, and my portion in the land of the living,</hi> God was not only to be his <hi>portion</hi> in the <hi>other world,</hi> in the <hi>land</hi> of <hi>eternity,</hi> if we may ſo call it, but he was to be his portion in this world, when he ſhould be ſurrounded with all the comforts the earth could afford him. It is true, <hi>David</hi> was now
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:64024:131"/>in an afflicted condition, he was in the <hi>cave,</hi> as the Title of the Pſalm ſhews, yet he had a <hi>promiſe</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> Now God was not only his <hi>refuge</hi> in his preſent diſtreſs, but he was reſolved that God ſhould be his <hi>portion in the land of the living;</hi> if ever he were brought to the Kingdom that was promiſed to him, yet God ſhould be all his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then. It is the property of <hi>grace</hi> to make a man account upon God more than he doth upon all the good things and comforts that he doth injoy. When he hath all theſe things about him, yet he accounts <hi>upon God,</hi> and <hi>what God is to him,</hi> above all theſe things.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> To ſhew us the <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> of Divine grace, conſider, It is always <hi>well</hi> with the ſoul when it is acted by Divine grace, and the ſoul is always full of <hi>trouble, confuſion</hi> and <hi>perplexity,</hi> when it is <hi>deſerted</hi> by Divine grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is always <hi>well</hi> with the ſoul when it is <hi>acted</hi> by Divine grace. There is an <hi>ineffable</hi> ſuavity that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies Divine grace; the ſoul feels the moſt perfect <hi>eaſe, quiet, ſerenity, ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> ſo far as it is acted by Divine grace. Obſerve your own <hi>experience</hi> and you
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:64024:132"/>ſhall find it true, ſo far as your hearts are acted by Divine grace, you will find an inward <hi>reſt, quiet,</hi> and ſerenity of mind. This made <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſay, that <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> grace conſiſted in a <hi>ſpiritual ſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</hi> Truly this <hi>ſpiritual ſuavity</hi> is <hi>inſeparable from Divine grace;</hi> ſo far as we are acted by Divine grace, we ſhall find inutterable <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> in it. The <hi>hardeſt</hi> things in Religion are made ſweet by Divine grace. The <hi>tears</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> are ſweet, and that which may ſeem a <hi>paradox</hi> is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true. <hi>Godly ſorrow</hi> is more <hi>ſweet</hi> to a man that is acted by Divine grace, than all the <hi>pleaſures of ſin</hi> are to a carnal man. <hi>Patience</hi> in <hi>bearing</hi> the <hi>croſs,</hi> is <hi>ſweet;</hi> for though <hi>afflictions themſelves</hi> are bitter, yet the <hi>grace of patience</hi> by which we bear afflictions, this is moſt ſweet. Yea <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> are ſweet, for though it be <hi>bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to nature to have our <hi>own</hi> wills <hi>croſt,</hi> yet when Divine grace helps us to conquer <hi>our wills,</hi> out of love to God, nothing is more ſweet. How ſweet is <hi>grace</hi> that ſweetens the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt things? The <hi>hardeſt things</hi> in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are made ſweet by Divine grace, O there is inutterable ſweetneſs in Divine
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:64024:132"/>grace! Could we always <hi>will</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi> as grace would teach us to <hi>will</hi> and <hi>deſire,</hi> we ſhould not complain of ſo many troubles as we do, for our <hi>troubles</hi> ariſe from hence, becauſe we do not act, as grace would teach us to act.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As it is <hi>always well</hi> with the ſoul when it is acted by Divine grace, ſo it is <hi>always ill with the ſoul,</hi> when it is deſerted in point of grace. When a man is left to himſelf, when there is nothing but nature or corruption that acts in him, then there is nothing but <hi>trouble</hi> and <hi>diſquietment,</hi> the ſoul is then in a tumult, all things are in a hurry. It is Divine grace that carries the ſoul to its <hi>centre,</hi> and when the ſoul is not acted towards God by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace, it is like a thing off from its centre, out of its place, and then the ſoul muſt needs be in a confuſion. How <hi>excellent</hi> and <hi>ſweet</hi> then muſt Divine grace be, that makes all things well with the ſoul whilſt it is acted by it, and all things <hi>ill</hi> with it when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by it. How do theſe things then call upon us to love and prize Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace? O it is one of the greateſt attainments in Chriſtianity, to ſee the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:64024:133"/>
                  <hi>need</hi> of <hi>Divine grace,</hi> and to long to be <hi>acted</hi> by <hi>Divine grace;</hi> and as we do come to greater atttainments in Chriſtianity, the <hi>more</hi> we ſhall ſee the <hi>need</hi> of Divine grace, and the more we ſhall deſire to be <hi>acted</hi> by Divine grace.</p>

               <p>I Come now to ſome other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to ſhew us the excellency of Divine grace. The laſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mentioned to ſet forth the excellency of grace, was taken from the <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> that is in Divine grace, and that was the <hi>third particular;</hi> we now come to a <hi>fourth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Excellency</hi> of <hi>Divine</hi> grace <hi>appears</hi> in this, That Divine grace,<note place="margin">The fourth Particular to ſhew the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Divine grace.</note> it is ſome kind of <hi>participation</hi> of <hi>God</hi> himſelf. Grace is that which cauſeth us in a meaſure to <hi>participate</hi> of the <hi>Divine Life,</hi> and of the <hi>Divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi> Hence is that expreſſion of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. <hi>That we are made partakers of the Divine nature.</hi> By the help of Divine grace
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:64024:134"/>we are brought to the neareſt ſimilitude to the <hi>Divine Life.</hi> For wherein doth the will of God conſiſt? It is the perfection of God to <hi>will himſelf</hi> as the <hi>laſt end,</hi> and to <hi>will</hi> all things <hi>relating</hi> to the <hi>creature</hi> in the moſt <hi>holy manner.</hi> This is the Divine perfection. Now by Divine grace it is that we are able to will God as our <hi>laſt end,</hi> and to <hi>will</hi> all other things <hi>regularly</hi> and <hi>conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> to the Divine will. It is the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of Heaven that we ſhall be <hi>like to God,</hi> 1 John 3.2. We ſhall be <hi>like him,</hi> that is, we ſhall be <hi>holy</hi> as he is <hi>holy, happy</hi> as he is <hi>happy,</hi> according to the capacity of the creature. Now by grace we are aſſimilated to God here on earth. None ſo like to God here on earth as he that is moſt acted by Divine grace.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another thing wherein the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Divine grace appears is this,<note place="margin">Partic. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> Divine grace is that which cauſeth a man to deny his own <hi>wiſdom,</hi> his own <hi>will,</hi> his own <hi>inclinations</hi> and <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and to refer himſelf wholly to the Divine <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> and to acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce therein. Thus did the power of Divine grace exert it ſelf, and ſhew it ſelf forth in our Saviour, and if we
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:64024:134"/>would look for grace, and ſee where grace is to be found in perfection, we muſt look to Chriſt, for he is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pattern of grace, in him grace act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſelf in perfection. The power of Divine grace in the heart of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſhewed it ſelf in this, to make him deny his <hi>own will</hi> and acquieſce in the <hi>Divine will,</hi> Matth. 26.37, 39. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if it be poſſible let this cup paſs from me: Nevertheleſs not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> Here we ſee our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour denies his <hi>own will,</hi> and refers himſelf to the fathers will; the <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deſire</hi> and <hi>inclination</hi> of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane will in our Saviour was to be kept from ſuffering. But now herein did the power of Divine grace appear in the heart of our Saviour, that he deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his own will and referred himſelf to his Fathers will, <hi>Not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> As much as if he had ſaid, not that which I deſire, not that which nature would think beſt, but that which thou in thy infinite wiſdom thinkeſt beſt, and which thy will determines. Much of the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace appears in this, in helping a man to conquer his own <hi>private will,</hi> his <hi>natural deſires</hi> and <hi>Inclinations.</hi>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:64024:135"/>When the <hi>Impetus</hi> and <hi>bent</hi> of nature lies this way, nature is carryed with a <hi>ſtrong current</hi> to ſuch a thing, then comes the power of Divine grace and helps a man to deny this ſtrong bent and inclination of nature, and carries him a quite contrary way, this ſhews the efficacy of Divine grace. And they that do not know what this means, know little of the power of grace. But thoſe that have felt the power of the grace of God upon their hearts, they know what theſe things mean.</p>
               <p n="6">6.<note place="margin">Partic. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> The Excellency of Divine grace appears in this, that it will cauſe a man to be <hi>ſatisfied in God,</hi> and <hi>with God, without other things.</hi> I have ſhewed formerly how grace cauſeth a man to live upon God <hi>in the midſt</hi> of other things. Now I muſt ſhew how grace will cauſe a man to be ſatisfied with God when he <hi>denies</hi> him other things. So much as a man is acted by Divine grace, he will <hi>adhere to God, live upon God</hi> and be <hi>ſatisfied with God</hi> when he wants other things. Not that a Godly man <hi>deſpiſeth</hi> and refuſeth the gifts of God which he beſtows upon him; he knows he may lawfully deſire and uſe the gifts of God in their proper places.
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:64024:135"/>But when God denies thoſe comforts to him that others have, or he himſelf hath a mind to, ſo far as a man is act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Divine grace, he will <hi>retire</hi> to God himſelf and <hi>adhere</hi> to him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting God to be his happineſs when he hath nothing elſe, Pſal. 16.5, 6. <hi>The Lord is the portion of mine inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and of my cup: thou maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt my lot. The lines are fallen unto me in pleaſant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.</hi> It is as much as if he had ſaid, though I have nothing left but God, yet I have enough in him, I am ſatisfied in him,<note place="margin">Divitiae noſtrae, Deus noſter. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>God is our riches</hi> ſaid that <hi>holy man.</hi> O let us pray for more Divine grace, and then we ſhall have more experience of this frame.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Excellency of Divine grace agpears in this,<note place="margin">Partic. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> that it <hi>elevates</hi> the ſoul to the <hi>deſire of the Heavenly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi> It is by the power of Divine grace that we come to <hi>breath</hi> much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>future life.</hi> It is ſaid of the <hi>antient Saints, Now they deſire a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter country, that is an Heavenly,</hi> Heb. 11.16. It was <hi>grace</hi> that elevated them unto this, for it is proper to nature to ſtick in preſent things. The natural deſires and affections that are in men
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:64024:136"/>cauſe them to deſire to live always here on earth. They <hi>know</hi> not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life, are not <hi>acquainted</hi> with it, and therefore they do not <hi>deſire</hi> it. It is Divine grace only that doth diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to men another life, and cauſeth them to ſuſpire and breath after that life, 2 Cor. 5.8. <hi>We are conſident, and willing rather to be abſent from the body, and to be preſent with the Lord. Paul</hi> knew there was <hi>another life,</hi> a more <hi>excellent life</hi> after this, he knew he ſhould be <hi>preſent with the Lord, and live with him,</hi> and this made him <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire</hi> and <hi>breathe</hi> after this life. It is only the grace of God can make a man breathe after the future life, for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of men that are not acted by Divine grace, ſtick in theſe things, and would always live here on earth.</p>
               <p n="8">8.<note place="margin">Partic. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> The Excellency of <hi>Divine</hi> grace appears in this, that it cauſeth a man to <hi>perſevere to the end.</hi> It is by the power of Divine grace that we are kept on in a <hi>way</hi> of faith and <hi>obedience</hi> to the end. Did not Divine grace ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port us, our <hi>faith would fail;</hi> and though we have overcome many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties already, yet our faith would flag at laſt, and we ſhould be ready to
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:64024:136"/>give up all our hopes. Therefore doth Chriſt tell <hi>Peter that he had prayed for him that his faith might not fail.</hi> This plainly intimates that if <hi>Peter</hi> had not had <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> from Divine grace, his faith would have failed. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we ſhould ſaint in the <hi>courſe</hi> of our <hi>obedience</hi> did not Divine grace ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and uphold us, Pſal. 73.13. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, I have cleanſed my heart in vain, and waſhed my hands in innocency,</hi> ſaith that <hi>holy man.</hi> When he was under the power of temptation, he was ready to give off his obedience, to give up the courſe of his walking with God, he began to repent he had been religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and walked with God. But now it is by the help of Divine grace that we are kept from fainting in the courſe of our obedience. The Lord hath promiſed that he will <hi>put his fear in our hearts that we ſhall not depart from him,</hi> Jer. 32.40.

                  </note> The laſt particular I ſhall mention to ſhew the excellency of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:64024:138"/>grace is this, It is the happineſs of Heaven to be always acted by Divine grace; to <hi>think,</hi> to <hi>love,</hi> to <hi>deſire,</hi> to <hi>will,</hi> to <hi>ſpeak,</hi> to <hi>act</hi> nothing but as Divine grace would teach and incline us to do, this is the perfection of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelf. What is the perfection of Heaven, but that we ſhall be full of grace and of the ſpirit of God? The perfection of Heaven conſiſts in this, that grace and the ſpirit of God ſhall act us <hi>univerſally,</hi> always, and in all things. The happineſs of Heaven is deſcribed by this, that <hi>God ſhall be all in all,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. <hi>And one way</hi> by which <hi>God</hi> is <hi>all in all</hi> is this, that in Heaven, we ſhall be <hi>full</hi> of the ſpirit of God, and that we ſhall be <hi>purely,</hi> and <hi>perfectly,</hi> and <hi>eternally</hi> acted by the ſpirit of God. Here <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>ſelf</hi> ſway us very much, but the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Heaven is this, that we ſhall be purely and ſolely acted by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> ſhall no more have the ſway in us, but we ſhall do every thing as the ſpirit of God acts us. How excellent is a <hi>Saint</hi> here on earth? What a <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>majeſty</hi> doth there appear in him here on earth, ſo far as he is acted by the ſpirit of God
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:64024:138"/>and by <hi>Divine grace?</hi> That which makes any thing <hi>uncomely</hi> in a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, is that nature, and corruption, and ſelf appears in him. But ſo far as grace and the ſpirit of God acts him, there is nothing but beauty, lovelineſs and comelineſs that appears in him. How excellent I ſay, is a Saint ſo far as he is acted by the grace of God here on earth? Oh but there are many mixtures of corruption, and imperfections in the beſt of the Saints here on earth, there is none of the Saints ſo perfectly acted by Divine grace, but ſomething of <hi>ſelf</hi> and <hi>corruption</hi> interpoſeth. O but in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven he ſhall be purely, and perfectly, and eternally acted by the ſpirit of God, nothing ſhall come from him then but what ſavours of the ſpirit of God. Now if the perfection of grace, be the perfection of Heaven it ſelf, how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then is Divine grace that brings us near to the life of Heaven?</p>
               <p>Thus have I ſhewn the excellency of Divine grace in ſeveral particulars.</p>
               <p>And what ſhould all that that we have heard concerning the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of grace, and the <hi>excellency</hi> of it teach us?</p>
               <p n="1">1. It ſhould cauſe us to <hi>love</hi> Divine
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:64024:139"/>grace, to <hi>prize</hi> it, and <hi>long</hi> after it more, to covet it, and pray for it more than we do for temporal things. Had we <hi>ſpiritual eyes</hi> to ſee the <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>excellency</hi> of <hi>Divine grace,</hi> we ſhould not be ſo fond of other things, and neglect <hi>grace,</hi> our main deſires would run out after grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We ſhould make this <hi>Uſe</hi> from what we have heard of the Doctrine of <hi>Divine grace,</hi> we ſhould pray that we may feel the <hi>operations</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> of Divine grace put forth in our ſouls. We have heard how that <hi>grace</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a man to deny his own <hi>wiſdom, will, affections, inclinations,</hi> and to <hi>reſign</hi> himſelf wholly to Gods will. We have heard how <hi>grace</hi> cauſeth a man to be <hi>ſatisfied in God</hi> and <hi>with God</hi> in the want of other things: We have heard how grace elevates the ſoul to the <hi>deſire</hi> of the <hi>Heavenly Country;</hi> how it cauſeth a man to perſevere in faith and obedience to the end, to lay down this life when God calls him thereunto. Now we ſhould pray to ſeel and find that <hi>preſence</hi> of <hi>Divine grace</hi> in our ſouls that we may be carried forth to all theſe things; <hi>then</hi> and <hi>never</hi> till then ſhall we know the ſweetneſs of
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:64024:139"/>Divine grace and the excellency of it, when we find theſe <hi>ſweet operations,</hi> and <hi>powerful effects</hi> of <hi>Divine grace</hi> upon our hearts. He that hath found theſe <hi>operations</hi> and <hi>workings of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace</hi> in his ſoul, cannot but <hi>love Divine grace</hi> above all other things whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Having ſhewed the <hi>Excellency of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace,</hi> it remains only that I ſhould propound ſome <hi>means</hi> in order to the obtaining of <hi>grace.</hi> God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to give a <hi>ſufficiency of grace</hi> to his people, <hi>My grace ſhall be ſufficient for thee.</hi> What are the moſt <hi>proper means</hi> for us to obtain <hi>ſufficiency of grace</hi> from God according to all our neceſſities?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us labour to be deeply <hi>ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> of the <hi>need</hi> of Divine grace.<note place="margin">Direct. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> Our <hi>Saviour</hi> telleth us, <hi>That without him we can do nothing,</hi> John 5. Although we have the <hi>habits</hi> of grace, yet we need <hi>actual grace</hi> to enable us to do any thing that is <hi>good. Paul</hi> ſaith, that to <hi>will</hi> was <hi>preſent,</hi> but how to <hi>perform</hi> that which was <hi>good</hi> he <hi>knew</hi> not: we need <hi>actual aſſiſting grace,</hi> to carry us through every duty. Now we ought to be deeply ſenſible of the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:64024:140"/>need we have of Divine grace.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.5.</note> 
                  <hi>God gives grace to the humble,</hi> the <hi>humble ſoul</hi> is the ſoul that God <hi>ſingles</hi> out to give grace unto, and when are we humble? Truly then are we humble when we are <hi>poor in ſpirit,</hi> when we are ſenſible of our own <hi>impotency</hi> and <hi>inability</hi> to do any thing that is <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually good</hi> without <hi>Divine</hi> grace. It is a ſpeech of the wiſe man, <hi>He that truſts in his own heart is a fool.</hi> There is nothing that hinders us more from the <hi>reception</hi> of <hi>Divine grace,</hi> than when we are <hi>ſelf-confident,</hi> and <hi>preſume</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our own ſufficiency. The promiſe is, <hi>my grace</hi> ſhall be ſufficient for thee. If we have a <hi>ſelf-fulneſs,</hi> a <hi>ſelf-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi> we are not like to have a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of Divine grace. What need hath he of a <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of grace <hi>from God</hi> that thinks he hath a ſufficiency of ſtrength <hi>in himſelf? Paul</hi> ſaith that he had not <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of himſelf to <hi>think any thing.</hi> We ought to be deeply ſenſible of our abſolute depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon Divine grace, and that without Divine grace we are nothing. One <hi>great reaſon</hi> why God ſuſpends and withholds <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> from us, is, becauſe we think that we have
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:64024:140"/>
                  <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>ſufficiency</hi> at our own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and becauſe we have been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out ſo and ſo formerly, and have been <hi>acted</hi> by <hi>Divine grace ſo and ſo,</hi> therefore we are ready to think it is in our own power to <hi>act</hi> as we have done. <hi>Therefore</hi> is it that God leaves us to our ſelves, to ſhew us what we are without the aſſiſtance of his grace. God will have us to ſee that <hi>all is of grace,</hi> and if he ſuſpend and withhold his grace never ſo little, we cannot do what we have done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we would obtain Divine grace,<note place="margin">Direct. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> let us <hi>prize grace</hi> above <hi>temporal things.</hi> Our deſires are apt to run out after <hi>other things,</hi> but the main of our deſires ſhould run out after Divine grace. Let me ſay (But O how few Chriſtians believe it, or live as if they did believe it?) That God doth more for us, in communicating the <hi>leaſt grace</hi> to us, than in beſtowing on us the <hi>greateſt temporal bleſſing.</hi> And the reaſon is plain, becauſe grace is in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a <hi>ſupernatural good. Grace</hi> lies in a <hi>tendency</hi> to our <hi>communion with God</hi> here, and our injoyment of him hereafter. Now grace being ſuch a gift as is of a higher rank and order
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:64024:141"/>than any temporal good, we ought to prize it as ſuch. I have often <hi>thought,</hi> ſo the Lord <hi>keep us from ſin,</hi> and <hi>give us a ſufficiency</hi> of grace to <hi>act</hi> us throughout our whole lives, we need not be greatly ſolicitous about any thing elſe. It is the greateſt happineſs in this world to be <hi>kept from ſin</hi> and to have a ſufficiency of grace to act us. Whatever <hi>temporal thing God denies us,</hi> if we have but a <hi>ſufficiency of grace</hi> to act us, and to help us to do that which is <hi>pleaſing</hi> in his ſight, it is <hi>enough.</hi> It was <hi>Pauls</hi> great <hi>option</hi> and wiſh, <hi>that whether preſent or abſent he might be acceptable to God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.9. Now as long as we are <hi>acted</hi> by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace we ſhall have a <hi>teſtimony</hi> in our ſelves that we are <hi>accepted</hi> of God. Not that the <hi>fundamental ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation</hi> of our perſons depends upon <hi>our grace</hi> and obedience, this depends upon the <hi>perfect obedience</hi> and <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But ſo far as we are <hi>acted</hi> by <hi>Divine</hi> grace, we ſhall have a teſtimony in our ſelves, that what we do is pleaſing to God. And canſt thou deſire a greater happineſs O Chriſtian than this, to have ſuch a teſtimony as <hi>Enoch</hi> had, that thou haſt pleaſed God?
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:64024:141"/>So far as thou art acted by Divine grace thou ſhalt have this teſtimony given thee that thou haſt pleaſed God, 1 John 3.22. <hi>Whatſoever we ask we receive of him, becauſe we keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and do thoſe things that are pleaſing in his ſight.</hi>

God hath given him to <hi>be head over all things,</hi> that is a great expreſſion, <hi>over all things,</hi> that is, <hi>to all intents and purpoſes.</hi> Chriſt is appointed head of the Church as to all <hi>ends,</hi> and <hi>uſes</hi> whatſoever, that whatever grace we need, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it from Chriſt as our head, and he is appointed of the Father to give it out. Therefore here lies our great concernment, to labour after a holy skill to derive grace from Chriſt as <hi>head of the Church.</hi> I am afraid, we are greatly defective here.

John 15.4. <hi>Abide in me, and I in you.</hi> We muſt learn that skill to <hi>abide in Chriſt</hi> by the <hi>attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive acts</hi> of faith, or we ſhall make little of ſanctification.</p>

               <p n="1">1. We muſt look to the <hi>humanity of Chriſt</hi> as the firſt <hi>receptacle</hi> of grace, John 1.14. <hi>The word was made fleſh full of grace and truth.</hi> The <hi>word,</hi> the <hi>ſecond perſon</hi> in <hi>Trinity aſſuming our nature,</hi> the <hi>humane nature in Chriſt,</hi> by means of the <hi>perſonal</hi> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on comes to be filled with all grace. The humane nature I ſay, by its <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal conjunction</hi> with the <hi>word,</hi> is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with <hi>grace,</hi> and therefore that <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi> follows, <hi>the word was made fleſh, full of grace and truth.</hi> No
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:64024:144"/>ſooner was our nature united to the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon</hi> in <hi>Trinity,</hi> but by means of <hi>this union,</hi> it comes to be filled with all grace. So that the <hi>humane nature</hi> in Chriſt is the firſt <hi>receptacle</hi> of grace, that is the firſt thing we are to attend unto.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt look to the <hi>divinity in Chriſt</hi> as <hi>repleniſhing</hi> his <hi>humanity</hi> with all grace, and in the <hi>humane nature aſſumed, becoming the fountain of grace to us,</hi> Col. 2.9. <hi>For in him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the God-head bodily.</hi> The <hi>fulneſs</hi> of the <hi>God-head</hi> by means of <hi>the perſonal</hi> union dwells in Chriſt, and mark it, <hi>by means of the perſonal union</hi> it becomes the <hi>fountain of grace</hi> to us. Firſt, it fills the <hi>humanity of Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>God-head</hi> fills the <hi>huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and by the <hi>humanity,</hi> and <hi>through</hi> the <hi>humanity</hi> it conveys <hi>grace</hi> to us. So that faith in having recourſe to Chriſt for <hi>actual grace,</hi> hath to do with <hi>both natures</hi> in Chriſt, the <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature,</hi> and the <hi>divine nature. Firſt, Faith</hi> hath to do with the <hi>humane nature,</hi> faith is to <hi>eye</hi> the <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature</hi> as the <hi>firſt receptacle of grace,</hi> and as the <hi>organ</hi> by which grace is conveyed to us. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Faith
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:64024:144"/>hath to do with the Divine nature as the principle <hi>efficient</hi> of all grace, Joh. 1.16. <hi>Of his fulneſs we receive grace for grace.</hi> This <hi>fulneſs</hi> here ſpoken of, is <hi>primarily</hi> and <hi>originally</hi> in the God-head, and then ſecondly, this <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> is <hi>derivatively</hi> in the <hi>humane nature</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that in theſe two reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that the humane nature in Chriſt hath all the <hi>habits</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> of grace impreſt upon it that nature is capable of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the <hi>humane nature</hi> is the <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> of the Divinity, <hi>in</hi> and by <hi>which</hi> all grace is <hi>diffuſed,</hi> and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto us. <hi>Of his fulneſs we receive grace for grace.</hi> Now we ſhould ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy more the way of <hi>having recourſe to Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>drawing</hi> actual grace from him; the more we can <hi>eye</hi> the <hi>Divinity</hi> in Chriſt as filling him with all Grace, and lean upon him as our Head for all grace, the more grace we ſhall receive from him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If we would obtain <hi>Divine grace,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Direct. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> let us be greatly <hi>thankful</hi> for <hi>what</hi> grace we have already received, <hi>To him that hath ſhall more be given.</hi> As we ſhould be thankful for <hi>all</hi> the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:64024:145"/>gifts of God, ſo eſpecially for the <hi>gift of grace,</hi> becauſe it is one of the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt and beſt of all the gifts of God. If we are bound to bleſs God for <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral mercies and favours,</hi> much more for <hi>Divine grace.</hi> Nothing will cauſe God ſooner to ſuſpend grace from us, than <hi>unthankfulneſs</hi> for what grace we have received. God would have us to know that <hi>grace</hi> is no <hi>ſmall gift,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we are not deeply ſenſible of what mercy God hath ſhewn us in giving us what grace we have already received, nothing is ſo likely to deprive us more of grace. God ſets a high price on his grace, and he would have us do ſo too, therefore if God have given us any grace, we ſhould be more thankful for that, than for any temporal bleſſing; <hi>And to him that hath ſhall more be given.</hi>

               <p>I Am now come to the laſt part of this Text. I did in the laſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe finiſh that clauſe, <hi>My grace ſhall be ſufficient for thee,</hi> where I took occaſion to handle the <hi>Doctrine of Grace.</hi> I come now to ſpeak to the laſt clauſe, which is in theſe words, <hi>For my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs.</hi> Theſe words, as likewiſe the <hi>former, My grace ſhall be ſufficient for thee,</hi> are the <hi>Lords</hi> own words to <hi>Paul,</hi> they were ſpoken <hi>immediately</hi> by the Lord himſelf to <hi>Paul,</hi> and therefore ought to bear ſo much the more weight with us. The <hi>perſon</hi> who ſpake theſe words was <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that appears from the end of the verſe. <hi>Moſt gladly therefore will I glory in my infirmity that the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:64024:146"/>power of Chriſt may reſt upon me. Paul</hi> had made his <hi>prayer to Chriſt, For this thing,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I beſought the Lord thrice,</hi> that is, the <hi>Lord Chriſt.</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the <hi>Lord Chriſt,</hi> I made my prayer unto Chriſt. Where we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve by the way, that it is lawful for us to <hi>direct</hi> our <hi>prayers</hi> to Chriſt, we may direct our prayers to either of the perſons in the Trinity, and we may direct our prayers to Chriſt, as <hi>Paul</hi> did here, I beſought the Lord, that is, the Lord Chriſt, ſo <hi>Stephen</hi> did Acts 7. <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Now as <hi>Paul</hi> had directed his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Chriſt, ſo he receives an anſwer from Chriſt, <hi>and he ſaid, My grace is ſufficient for thee, for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs. And he ſaid,</hi> who was this that ſaid this? It was <hi>he</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> had directed his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to, to wit, the <hi>Lord Chriſt.</hi> As we may lawfully pray to Chriſt, ſo Chriſt is able to hear and anſwer our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, John 14.13, 14. <hi>Whatſoever you ask the Father in my name, I will do it,</hi> he doth not ſay the father will do it, but <hi>I will do it.</hi> Now the anſwer Chriſt gives to <hi>Paul</hi> is this, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee, for
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:64024:146"/>my ſtrength is made perfect in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. My grace is ſufficient for thee,</hi> of that I have already ſpoken, that which I have now to ſpeak of is the latter clauſe, <hi>For my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs.</hi> Now this latter clauſe, <hi>For my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs,</hi> is a <hi>reaſon</hi> and explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the former clauſe, <hi>My grace ſhall be ſufficient for thee. Paul</hi> had prayed that the <hi>thorn in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Satan</hi> might depart from him, Chriſt doth not give this anſwer to <hi>Paul,</hi> that this ſhall be done for him, that he prayes for, Chriſt doth not tell him, that the temptation ſhall be removed and taken away, but he gives in this anſwer, that his grace ſhall be ſufficient for him. The tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation was ſtill to continue upon <hi>Paul,</hi> but <hi>Paul</hi> was to have a <hi>ſufficiency of grace</hi> to help him under the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now in the <hi>Text,</hi> Chriſt gives the <hi>reaſon,</hi> why it is that he takes this courſe, that temptation ſhall continue upon <hi>Paul,</hi> and not be removed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, but he ſhall have grace to aſſiſt him under his temptation. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why <hi>Chriſt</hi> takes this courſe with <hi>Paul</hi> is, that ſo by this means Chriſts
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:64024:147"/>
                  <hi>power,</hi> Chriſts <hi>vertue,</hi> Chriſts <hi>ſtrength,</hi> may be <hi>illuſtrated,</hi> and <hi>made known</hi> ſo much the more. Such was <hi>Pauls infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> of himſelf would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſuccumb, and faint under his temptations, he would certainly be ovecome by them, if he were left to himſelf. Now the Lord had two ends in continuing <hi>Pauls</hi> temptation upon him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To ſhew to <hi>Paul</hi> his <hi>own infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> to diſcover to him his <hi>own impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency</hi> and <hi>inability</hi> to ſtand under his temptation <hi>if left to himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then, 2. Another end of Chriſt was to make known his <hi>power</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> that when <hi>Pauls</hi> infirmity would certainly have ſuffered him to fall, yet the power and grace of Chriſt ſhould make him ſtand. This I take to be the proper ſcope and deſign of theſe words, <hi>For my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs.</hi> Chriſt would have <hi>Pauls</hi> temptation to continue up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, that by this means his power and grace might be ſo much the more illuſtrated in ſupporting <hi>Paul</hi> under his infirmity. The words are <hi>plain,</hi> and are eaſily reſolved into this <hi>propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. What are we to underſtand by infirmity, <hi>My ſtrength is made perfect
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:64024:148"/>in weakneſs or infirmity;</hi> there are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities</hi> of ſeveral ſorts and kinds: but there are three ſorts of infirmities that are principally intended in this Text.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There are <hi>natural</hi> infirmites.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Moral</hi> infirmities.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There are the <hi>accidents</hi> or <hi>occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences</hi> that fall out in humane life; all theſe may be well taken in here.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There are <hi>natural infirmities.</hi> Now <hi>natural infirmities,</hi> are either <hi>infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of the <hi>body</hi> or of the <hi>mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. There are <hi>infirmities</hi> of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Infirmities of the body are ſuch as theſe, <hi>weakneſs, ſicklineſs, Craſineſs</hi> of the natural temper, all manner of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes and diſtempers that are incident to the bodies of men, theſe come under the name of <hi>natural infirmites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There are <hi>infirmities</hi> of the <hi>mind,</hi> as namely <hi>meanneſs</hi> and <hi>lowneſs</hi> of parts, <hi>dulneſs of apprehenſion, ſhallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>weakneſs</hi> in the judgement, unretentiveneſs in the memory, and the like, theſe are infirmities apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the ſoul, and theſe are the firſt ſort of infirmities, namely, thoſe that we call <hi>natural infirmities,</hi> belonging to the <hi>body</hi> or <hi>mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There are <hi>moral infirmites,</hi> now
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:64024:148"/>by <hi>moral infirmites</hi> we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Weakneſs</hi> and imperfection of grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>reliques</hi> and <hi>remainders</hi> of ſin and corruption in the Saints, and the Saints of God labour under theſe infirmities.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is <hi>weakneſs</hi> and <hi>imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of grace in the Saints. Though they have <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>ſincerity</hi> of grace, yet there is a great <hi>imperfection</hi> of grace in them, <hi>imperfection</hi> in their <hi>knowledge, we know but in part,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.9.</note> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks, imperfection in their <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and other <hi>graces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Saints,</hi> they have the <hi>reliques</hi> and <hi>remainders</hi> of ſin in them. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> complains, <hi>In me, that is in my fleſh, there dwells no good thing,</hi> Rom. 7.18. and in the laſt verſe of that Chapter, <hi>with the fleſh he ſerved the law of ſin.</hi> Now theſe <hi>reliques</hi> and <hi>remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> of ſin that are in the Saints may properly be called <hi>infirmities,</hi> becauſe though the Saints have theſe infirmities, theſe reliques and remainders of ſin in them, yet theſe do not reign in them, they feel the bent of their will ſet againſt ſin; though ſin hath a <hi>being</hi>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:64024:149"/>in them, and though they find the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of it, ariſing from corruption and the unregenerate part in them, yet the bent of their will is ſet againſt it. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in that Text be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>With my mind I ſerve the Law of God, but with my fleſh the law of ſin; with my mind I ſerve the law of God,</hi> the deliberate purpoſe of his will, the bent of his will was ſet againſt it, though by reaſon of the remainders of ſin in his fleſh, he was many times ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, overtaken, carried often contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that which was the deliberate purpoſe of his will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By <hi>infirmities,</hi> we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the <hi>accidents</hi> and <hi>occurrences</hi> that do belong to humane life, as <hi>croſſes, loſſes, hardſhips, difficulties, diſtreſſes,</hi> and the like, whatever may fall out in the courſe of providence that may tend to debaſe us, or depreſs us and lay us low, all theſe things come under the name of <hi>infirmity.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tam naturae no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrae imbecilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas, quam om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia abjectionis argumenta. <hi>Calvin.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> obſerves that <hi>infirmity</hi> in this place is a <hi>general name</hi> and under it is comprehended, as well <hi>the imbecillity of our nature, as all thoſe things that fall out in providence that may tend to humble us.</hi> Whatever falls out in providence that tends to humble
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:64024:149"/>us, this comes under the name of the Saints infirmities. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> himſelf in the words after the Text teaches us what he underſtands by <hi>infirmities</hi> in verſ. 10. <hi>Therefore I take pleaſure in infirmitie, in reproach, in neceſſity, in perſecution, in diſtreſs, for</hi> Chriſt's <hi>ſake,</hi> for <hi>when I am weak then am I ſtrong.</hi> Here we ſee the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> joyns <hi>infirmity</hi> with <hi>reproaches, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, perſecutions</hi> and diſtreſs, ſo that whatever was matter of abaſement and humiliation to <hi>Paul,</hi> theſe he reckoned a part of his infirmities.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> thing we are to ſpeak to in the Text is, what we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by the <hi>power of Chriſt, my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs, or infirmity,</hi> what are we to underſtand by this ſtrength or <hi>power</hi> of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>To open this, we muſt know, that <hi>Chriſts power</hi> may be conſidered in the <hi>root,</hi> or in the <hi>effect.</hi> The power of Chriſt conſidered in the <hi>Root,</hi> is that <hi>vertue,</hi> that <hi>ſtrength,</hi> that is in Chriſt himſelf. Chriſts power is infinite. Chriſts power conſidered in it ſelf is the ſame with the Fathers power, <hi>I and the Father are one,</hi> John 10.30.
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:64024:150"/>
                  <hi>I and my Father are one,</hi> that is, one in eſſence, and one in power. And here it is well obſerved by a <hi>learned man,</hi> that in this <hi>Text</hi> we have a proof of Chriſts <hi>divinity.</hi> For if it be <hi>Chriſts pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> that carries the Saints through their difficulties and temptations, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Chriſt muſt needs be <hi>God.</hi> Now the Apoſtle tells us it was the <hi>power of Chriſt</hi> that <hi>reſted</hi> upon him, that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him through all his temptations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſt gladly therefore will I rather glory in mine infirmities, that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon me.</hi> If it was the <hi>power of Chriſt</hi> that carried <hi>Paul</hi> through all his temptations and trials, and which carries the Saints through all their trials and temptations, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt muſt needs be God, for nothing but infinite and an almighty power can carry the Saints through all thoſe difficulties and temptations they are exerciſed with.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>power of Chriſt</hi> may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the <hi>effect,</hi> and ſo the power of Chriſt is nothing elſe but the effect of his power put forth in us, Eph. 3.20. <hi>According to the power that works in us.</hi> There is a <hi>power</hi> put forth in us, and
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:64024:150"/>that is the power that is here meant, <hi>My power is made perfect in infirmity,</hi> that is, the <hi>energy, efficacy</hi> and <hi>operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of my power, is ſeen in mens infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. This I take to be the plain meaning, <hi>mans infirmity</hi> makes way for the <hi>putting forth</hi> of the <hi>effects</hi> of my power in him. Now there is a twofold power of Chriſt that we may diſtinguiſh of.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is the <hi>power</hi> of his <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>power</hi> of his <hi>grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. There is the <hi>power</hi> of his <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, God hath ſpoken once, yea twice have I heard this, that power belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto God,</hi> Pſal. 62.11. <hi>power belongeth unto God,</hi> that is, <hi>power</hi> to <hi>adminiſter</hi> and order all things in his providence as he pleaſeth. So in Heb. 1.3. <hi>Upholding all things by the word of his power.</hi> Now the power of Chriſts providence is ſeen in mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, that is, the greater mans weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and infirmity is, the more is the power of Divine providence ſeen in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is the power of <hi>Chriſts grace,</hi> obſerve how the words lie, <hi>My grace ſhall be ſufficient for thee, for my
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:64024:151"/>ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs,</hi> here grace and power ſeem to be <hi>ſyno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous,</hi> they ſeem to be put one for another; Chriſts <hi>grace</hi> is his <hi>power;</hi> Chriſts <hi>grace</hi> is that <hi>Divine help</hi> and <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> he gives to us, and his power it is his <hi>grace,</hi> that aſſiſtance of grace which he gives to his. So that the plain meaning is, <hi>My power is made perfect in weakneſs,</hi> that is, <hi>the power of my providence</hi> and <hi>of my grace</hi> is made perfect in mans infirmity.</p>
               <p>The 3. term to be explained in the Text is this, How is it that <hi>Chriſts power is perfected</hi> in infirmity,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That mans infirmity gives <hi>occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to Chriſt to put forth his power; <hi>My ſtrength is perfected in infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> as much as if it had been ſaid, <hi>My</hi> power hath <hi>occaſion,</hi> or <hi>matter</hi> of exerting it ſelf when mans infirmity is diſcovered. God is not wont to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, and put forth his power, till our
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:64024:151"/>infirmity appears; and when our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity doth appear, then is the time and ſeaſon Chriſt is wont to put forth his power. There are many great Scriptures ſpeak to this, <hi>For the Lord ſhall judge his people, and repent himſelf for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; when he ſeeth that their power is gone, and there is none ſhut up or left,</hi> Deut. 32.36. So in Iſa. 40.29. <hi>He gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth power to the faint, and to them that have no might, he increaſeth ſtrength:</hi> and it is a great expreſſion that, Hoſ. 14.3. <hi>In him the Fatherleſs findeth mercy.</hi> It is an expreſſion I have read of <hi>Luthers</hi> upon that Text, It is a thing <hi>defined</hi> and <hi>determined,</hi> that if thou wilt <hi>find mercy,</hi> thou muſt be <hi>fatherleſs.</hi> God ſhews mercy to none but thoſe that are <hi>fatherleſs.</hi> Thou muſt firſt be fatherleſs, thou muſt be helpleſs, thou muſt have no ſtrength before God ſhew thee mercy. The creature muſt be reduced to nothing in it ſelf, before God put forth his ſtrength to help us. And it is another expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Luther,</hi> God in his proper form and nature is ſuch a God who loves afflicted perſons, and who hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion upon them who are in diſtreſs,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:64024:152"/>who are depreſt and brought low. <hi>I was brought low and he helped me,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt. God puts forth his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then when man is brought loweſt.</p>
               <p>The 2. thing implied is this, That Chriſts power it is made <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>conſpicuous</hi> to us by our infirmities. We ſhould never have ſo <hi>clear</hi> a <hi>ſight</hi> of <hi>Divine grace,</hi> had not we firſt a ſight and ſenſe of our own infirmitie. This expreſſion of being <hi>perfected, My ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs,</hi> it hath relation to our <hi>ſenſe,</hi> the <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>feeling</hi> of our own infirmity is that which gives us experience of Gods power ſo much the more. Had we no <hi>ſenſe</hi> of our own infirmity, we ſhould be apt to think we had a ſufficiency in our ſelves, but when we ſee and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our own infirmity, then we ſee it is by anothers ſtrength and not by our own, that we are inabled to do and ſuffer what we do and ſuffer. If we had not ſome <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> of our own <hi>infirmity,</hi> we ſhould think the ſtrength and ſufficiency were in our ſelves. O but God leaves us under infirmitie, that we may ſee the <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>ability</hi> God affords us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:64024:152"/>infirmity, is anothers, and not our own. This I take to be the meaning of the words, <hi>My ſtrength is made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in infirmity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 4. thing which we are to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into, and that which is of great moment in this matter, is this,</p>
               <p>What is that <hi>power</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> of Chriſt that is put forth and made known in our infirmity?</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Supporting grace</hi> is made known by our infirmity. Our infirmity is a means whereby the grace of Chriſt in <hi>ſupporting</hi> us is ſeen more clearly. When our burdens are many, and our <hi>preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi> great upon us, it is a wonder we do not ſink and faint under them, and therefore when we are under great <hi>trials, preſſures</hi> and <hi>tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> it is infinite power that doth ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port us, and the power of Chriſt is then made known in infirmity when we are ſupported under ſuch burdens and temptations, which were enough to ſink fleſh and blood, and to cruſh ſuch poor <hi>frail creatures</hi> as we are. I ſay, <hi>ſupporting</hi> grace is made viſible by the Saints <hi>infirmities. Iſa.</hi> 41.10. It is the promiſe of God to the Church,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:64024:153"/>and though it is ſpoken to the Church in general, yet it is applicable to the particular members of the Church, <hi>I will ſtrengthen thee, yea I will help thee, yea I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteouſneſs.</hi> Here is ſupporting grace. Pſal. 145.7. <hi>The Lord upholdeth them that fall,</hi> that is, God upholdeth them that are <hi>ready</hi> to fall. The Saints of God are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times near <hi>overwhelming,</hi> ſo great are the <hi>burdens</hi> and preſſures that they lie under, that they are almoſt ſunk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, then doth God put under <hi>his everlaſting arms,</hi> and <hi>upholds</hi> them. It is a pregnant Text, Pſal. 94.17, 18. <hi>Unleſs the Lord had been my help, my ſoul had almoſt dwelt in ſilence,</hi> that is, I had been a <hi>loſt man,</hi> I had given my ſelf for <hi>loſt, My ſoul had almoſt dwelt in ſilence,</hi> that is, I had gone down to <hi>the grave,</hi> the <hi>place</hi> of <hi>ſilence.</hi> My afflictions and preſſures were ſo great, that they would have brought me down to the <hi>grave,</hi> the <hi>place</hi> of <hi>ſilence,</hi> compare this with Pſal. 115.17. <hi>The dead praiſe not the Lord, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any that go down into ſilence,</hi> that is, <hi>the grave</hi> the place of ſilence. So
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:64024:153"/>that the meaning is, unleſs the Lord had been my help, my ſoul had almoſt dwelt in ſilence, that is, my afflictions had <hi>ſunk</hi> me, and <hi>ſwallowed</hi> me up, brought me down to the grave. And then mark what follows in the next verſe, <hi>When I ſaid my foot ſlippeth, thy mercy O Lord held me up,</hi> here is <hi>upholding grace,</hi> and this was ſeen in the infirmity of this Holy man, which before he mentions, the infirmity of this Holy man made way for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovery of this grace of God towards him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Aſſiſting grace</hi> is made perfect by our <hi>infirmity;</hi> the experience we have of the <hi>riſings</hi> of our own <hi>corruptions,</hi> and the <hi>inſinuation</hi> of Satans tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and alſo the experience we have of our own inability to deal either with the one or the other, ſhews us how much we are beholding to aſſiſting grace to inable us to withſtand or overcome them. And this ſeems to be the caſe in the Text, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw an inability in himſelf to deal with the <hi>thorn in the fleſh,</hi> that is, to grapple with thoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of corruption that Satans tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations did extimulate and ſtir up in
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:64024:154"/>him. Now the Lord promiſeth him his aſſiſting grace, <hi>My grace ſhall be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for thee.</hi> Now the power of God helping him to overcome theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and temptations which he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted with, was the more illuſtrated by this means, the power of aſſiſting grace to inable <hi>Paul</hi> to overcome his temptation was more ſeen, than if <hi>Paul</hi> had no temptation at all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Recovering</hi> or <hi>reſtoring</hi> grace is made perfect by our infirmitie, Pſal. 23.3. <hi>Thou reſtoreſt my ſoul.</hi> Thus the grace of Chriſt recovered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored <hi>Peter</hi> after his fall. When <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> denied his Maſter, and our Saviour <hi>looked</hi> upon him, and conveyed his grace by that <hi>look,</hi> this begat repentance in <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 26.75.</note> 
                  <hi>he went out, and wept bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly.</hi> Our infirmities make way for the illuſtrating the glory of <hi>reſtoring</hi> and <hi>renewing</hi> grace. For as we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to preſerve and keep our ſelves from falling, ſo we are as unable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover our ſelves when we are fallen. It is the grace of Chriſt which brings our hearts into frame, after they have been out of frame, Pſal. 51.10. <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in me a clean heart O God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:64024:154"/>a right ſpirit within me. David</hi> needed a work of <hi>creation</hi> to paſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, after his fall. His heart was ſo diſordered by ſin, that it had need be ſet right again, and therefore he prays, Renew in me a right ſpirit. Sin had <hi>diſtempered</hi> him, and therefore he needed the grace of God to rectifie, and ſet things right in him. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring our own hearts into frame when they are out of frame. We ſhould pine and languiſh away under our relapſes did not Divine grace ſet us right. Now this is that which il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrates the Grace of Chriſt, that when we cannot recover or reſtore our ſelves, after our falls, he recovers and reſtores us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly, Reviving</hi> and <hi>comforting grace</hi> is made known by the Saints in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities. The Children of God have their <hi>fainting fits, holy</hi> and <hi>experienced ſouls</hi> know what belong to them. When their preſſures are great, when their temptations and trials have been long and ſore upon them, this brings them even to fainting, they are ready to ſay with <hi>Daniel, they retain no more ſtrength, neither have they any ſpirit
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:64024:155"/>in them. David</hi> complains, Pſal. 119.25. <hi>My ſoul cleaveth to the very duſt.</hi> And a verſe or two after he ſaith, <hi>My ſoul droppeth or melteth away for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs.</hi> And <hi>Jonah</hi> ſaith, <hi>My ſoul fainted within me,</hi> Jonah 2.7. <hi>Secure perſons,</hi> who live at eaſe, and have no experience of temptation, and ſpiritual conflicts, know not the meaning of theſe things, but <hi>holy experienced ſouls</hi> know the meaning of them. The Saints of God are ſometimes brought to ſuch extremities, by their afflictions and temptations, that they are even in a manner <hi>overwhelmed</hi> by them. The <hi>title</hi> of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. is remarkable to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence this, <hi>A prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the Lord.</hi> The Saints then are ſometimes overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their ſorrows and temptations. Now theſe <hi>fainting fits</hi> the Saints are caſt into, make way for <hi>reviving or comforting grace,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.6. <hi>God who comforts them that are caſt down.</hi> It is one of the <hi>titles</hi> given to God, <hi>God that comforts them that are caſt down,</hi> and it is a great Text which was hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, Iſa. 40.29. <hi>He gives power
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:64024:155"/>to the faint, and to them that have no might he increaſeth ſtrength.</hi> Were not the Saints brought to theſe faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſometimes, were they not brought to this, to think, they had <hi>no ſtrength,</hi> no might, they would not ſee the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God which revives them, when they are brought to the very brink of the grave, to the very brink of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>This ſhould teach us <hi>cheerfully</hi> to ſubmit to thoſe afflictions, trials, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, and all manner of exerciſes that God is pleaſed to exerciſe us with. Under the name of <hi>infirmitie,</hi> all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of afflictions and trials are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. Now if Chriſts power be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in our infirmity, that is, by our tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, temptations, exerciſes, we ſhould cheerfully ſubmit to this diſcipline, James 1.2. <hi>Count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations,</hi> that is, when you fall into divers <hi>afflictions</hi> and <hi>trials, count it all joy;</hi> a ſtrange Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to fleſh and blood! what is it a matter of <hi>joy</hi> to be afflicted? Is it a ground for <hi>all joy</hi> for a man to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted? Truly, it is ſo in reſpect of the conſequents, it is not ſo in reſpect of it
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:64024:156"/>ſelf. Look upon affliction in it ſelf, and no affliction is for the preſent <hi>joyous</hi> but <hi>grievous,</hi> ſo the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.11. But it is a matter of joy to fall into afflictions in reſpect of the <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, count it all joy when ye fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to divers temptations.</hi> Why ſo? The following words tell us, <hi>knowing that the trial of your faith worketh patience.</hi> The Saints <hi>afflictions</hi> ſo far as they are ſanctified, are a means to increaſe their <hi>faith</hi> and patience, and the <hi>gain</hi> of a little grace by our afflictions makes amends for all our afflictions. If we gain <hi>faith</hi> or patience, or any grace whatſoever by our afflictions, the <hi>gain</hi> of a little grace is a <hi>greater good</hi> than there is evil in our afflictions. Beſides, if Gods ſtrength, and power, be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in our weakneſs and infirmity, we ought willingly to ſubmit to thoſe trials, and afflictions, and temptations that he laies upon us. We are bound (though it be a hard leſſon to fleſh and blood) to love the glory of God above our own eaſe and quiet. If therefore the power and grace of Chriſt, be il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated in our afflictions and exerciſes, it becomes us the more cheerfully to
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:64024:156"/>ſubmit to them, becauſe God will have a revenue of glory this way. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it is an expreſſion of <hi>Luther,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chriſtianus ſine afflictionibus nil <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>A Chriſtian without affliction is worth nothing.</hi> We would fain take up with an <hi>eaſie Chriſtianity,</hi> we would fain carry on a <hi>ſmooth eaſie profeſſion</hi> without rubs or difficulties, or any conſiderable exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes and trials. We would have no temptations, we would meet with no troubles or afflictions in our way; but alas it will not be. Therefore let us remember this Text, <hi>My ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs.</hi> God will find out ſomething or other to exerciſe us with all our days, and if we ſhould be without exerciſes, God would loſe his glory and we ſhould loſe the grace and experience that is gotten by theſe trials. Let us pray much that ſin may <hi>be kept out</hi> of our afflictions; if ſin be kept out of our trials and afflictions, none of our afflictions will do us hurt.</p>

               <p>THE Doctrine propounded from theſe words was,</p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>Chriſts ſtrength is perfected in our infirmity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I come now to the grounds and reaſons of the Doctrine which I ſhall briefly ſpeak to, and then come to the Application.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> For the grounds of the point, Why is it that God takes this courſe?</p>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:64024:157"/>
               <p n="1">1. To let us ſee <hi>our infirmity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then, 2. To perfect his ſtrength or power in our infirmity.</p>
               <p>There are two grounds of this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>Gods deſign</hi> is to humble us.<note place="margin">Reaſon <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> Now the ſenſe of our infirmity is <hi>the proper means</hi> to humble us. It is a true <hi>ſaying,</hi> and a <hi>ſaying</hi> we can never think of too often, <hi>The founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of humility is the knowledge of ſome defect, or imperfection in our ſelves.</hi> Whilſt we have a <hi>ſelf-fulneſs,</hi> a <hi>ſelf-ſufficiency,</hi> whilſt we apprehend nothing but wiſdom, <hi>ſtrength, ability,</hi> and excellency in our ſelves, this lifts us up. For Pride, what is it, but a <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement</hi> or <hi>ſtrong</hi> opinion <hi>of a mans</hi> own proper excellency? Now whilſt we apprehend nothing but excellency in our ſelves, this lifts us up, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in his infinite wiſdom diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers to us our weakneſs, impotency, infirmity and imperfection, and the ſight of our own infirmity and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is a means to take down our <hi>plumes,</hi> and to depreſs and humble us. Now <hi>our humiliation</hi> makes way for <hi>Gods exaltation.</hi> The more the creature is humbled and debaſed, the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:64024:158"/>more is God exalted. This is certain, when any excellency of the creature is ſeen and admired too much, the excellency of God is ſo much the more unſeen; the admiration of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures excellency is a means to darken the glory of God, and therefore God draws a <hi>Vail</hi> upon our glory, that ſo God may be the more ſeen, Iſa. 2.17. <hi>The loftineſs of man ſhall be bowed down, and the haughtineſs of man ſhall be made low, and the Lord alone ſhall be exalted in that day.</hi> When all created excellency is laid low, then is Gods excellency the more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced.</p>
               <p>The 2.<note place="margin">Reaſon <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> Reaſon is this, Gods ſtrength is perfected in our infirmity, becauſe the ſenſe of our infirmity makes us to ſee <hi>that all is of grace.</hi> When God hath reduced us to <hi>nothingneſs</hi> in our ſelves, when God hath made us to ſee that we <hi>are</hi> nothing, that we can <hi>do</hi> nothing, then we clearly ſee, that all that we <hi>are,</hi> and all that we <hi>have,</hi> is of grace. It is <hi>natural</hi> to us to arrogate too much to our ſelves, to aſcribe things to our own <hi>ſtrength, ſufficiency</hi> and <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and therefore
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:64024:158"/>the Lord ſhews us our own folly, how unable we are to ſatisfie our ſelves in difficult caſes. How often do we meet with ſuch difficulties and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities in our lives that are beyond all our own wiſdom to know how to reſolve our ſelves in them, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate our ſelves out of them? And God in his <hi>infinite wiſdom</hi> leads us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe difficulties to make us ſee that it is beyond our <hi>own wiſdom</hi> to help us out of them. And he alſo ſheweth us our own <hi>weakneſs</hi> and impotency, to <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand</hi> ſuch <hi>temptations</hi> as we meet with in our courſe, and then we clearly ſee that <hi>all is of grace;</hi> if we have any wiſdom ſtrength and ſufficiency to help us in our difficulties and temptations, it is all of Divine grace. So that God firſt reduceth us to nothingneſs, and then helps us, to ſhew us that all is of grace, and that we may ſet the <hi>Crown</hi> upon the head of grace, and attribute nothing to our ſelves.</p>
               <p>I come to the <hi>Uſe</hi> and <hi>Application</hi> of the Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Is it ſo, that <hi>Chriſts ſtrength is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in mans infirmity?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:64024:159"/>
               <p>The firſt Uſe ſhall be,</p>
               <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">Uſe <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> By way of <hi>information,</hi> This ſhews us, nothing doth more <hi>obſtruct Divine grace,</hi> and ſhut the door againſt it than <hi>ſelf-fulneſs,</hi> and <hi>preſumption</hi> of our own <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and ſufficiency. In the Text it is ſaid, <hi>My ſtrength is made perfect in infirmity,</hi> that is, the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of our infirmities makes way for the <hi>manifeſtation</hi> of <hi>Divine grace.</hi> Elſewhere it is ſaid, <hi>God gives grace to the humble,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.5. and in the ſame place, where it is ſaid, <hi>God gives grace to the humble,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>He reſiſts the proud.</hi> Look as <hi>humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> prepares us for the reception of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace:</hi> ſo on the contrary, pride obſtructs, and ſtops the current of Divine grace. The <hi>low valleys</hi> are watered and receive the bleſſing of the ſhowers from Heaven, whereas the tops of the high mountains remain dry and barren. Thus God delights to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh low and humble ſouls with the dews of Divine and Heavenly grace, whereas ſuch as are proud and lifted up with the conceit of their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies and perfections, receive none of thoſe Divine <hi>dews</hi> and <hi>ſhowers</hi> of

                  <note place="margin">ut tanquam in tabernaculo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bab tet in me potentia Chriſti.</note> therefore <hi>Beza</hi> renders it, <hi>that the power of Chriſt may inhabit in me as in a Tent or Tabernacle.</hi> To open this <hi>expreſſion,</hi> two things ſeem to be intimated in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we are poor weak frail <hi>veſſels;</hi> that our bodies are like to <hi>Tents</hi> or <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> the body is often compared to a <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.1. <hi>For we know that if our earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly houſe of this Tabernacle, were diſſolved, we have a building of God, a houſe not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens.</hi> Here the <hi>body</hi> is compared to a <hi>tabernacle,</hi> and ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> uſeth the ſame expreſſion, <hi>As long as I am in this my tabernacle;</hi> and in the very next verſe, <hi>knowing ſhortly that I
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:64024:164"/>muſt put off this my Tabernacle,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.13, 14. The body is like a poor Tent or Tabernacle, the <hi>ſtakes</hi> of it are not ſo ſtrong, and <hi>deeply fixt,</hi> but it may ſoon be taken down, ſoon removed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The expreſſion intimates the need we have of <hi>Divine power</hi> and ſtrength to ſupport us, <hi>that the power of Chriſt may Tabernacle upon me,</hi> it is as much as if the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſhould ſay, this poor Tabernacle of mine would be ſoon blown down, did not a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine hand keep it up, and ſupport it, therefore <hi>Pauls</hi> ambition was that Chriſts power might <hi>reſt</hi> upon him.</p>
               <p>But here it may be askt,</p>
               <p>When may Chriſts power be ſaid to reſt upon us?</p>
               <p n="1">1. When we have a <hi>preſent ſenſe</hi> of Chriſts power in our <hi>extremities;</hi> thus <hi>Paul</hi> a little after, in the Text, <hi>When I am weak, then am I ſtrong,</hi> verſ. 10. How ſo? <hi>When I am weak, then am I ſtrong;</hi> this ſeems to be a contradiction! But the plain meaning is, when he had the <hi>greateſt ſenſe of his own infirmity,</hi> then he had the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:64024:165"/>moſt experience of <hi>Chriſts power</hi> put forth in him, mans extremity is Gods opportunity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then do we find the power of Chriſt <hi>reſt</hi> upon us, when we find the power of Chriſt <hi>ſtrengthning</hi> of us to <hi>bear</hi> afflictions, 1 Col. 11. <hi>Strengthned with all might according to his glorious power, unto all patience, and long-ſuffering with joyfulneſs.</hi> It is the <hi>power of Chriſt</hi> in the Saints that ſtrengthens them to <hi>all patience,</hi> and then doth the power of Chriſt reſt upon them, when <hi>by</hi> the power of Chriſt they are inabled to bear afflictions with <hi>joyfulneſs,</hi> Phil. 4.13. <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt ſtrengthning me, I am able to do all things,</hi> or <hi>I have power to do all things,</hi> ſo the word ſignifies, <hi>I have power</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> to do all things,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> and what were theſe things, that <hi>Paul</hi> had a power to do? <hi>He could want, he could abound, he could be full, he could be hungry,</hi> he could bear all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with an <hi>equal mind. He had learned in whatſoever ſtate he was, therewith to be content.</hi> Now it was the <hi>power of Chriſt reſting on him</hi>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:64024:165"/>that inabled him to do this. Nature cannot bear ſuch viciſſitudes, changes and variety of conditions with an equal mind. Nature <hi>frets</hi> and <hi>ſtorms</hi> when it meets with variety of troubles. O but the <hi>power</hi> of Chriſt <hi>reſting</hi> upon <hi>Paul</hi> made him bear all <hi>changes</hi> with an equal mind. Nothing but the <hi>power of Chriſt reſting on us</hi> will make us bear all conditions, afflictions and changes with an equal mind. And then doth the power of Chriſt reſt upon us, when by the ſtrength of his grace we are inabled to bear up under all the afflictions that we meet with in the courſe of our pilgrimage.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Then may the power of Chriſt be ſaid to <hi>reſt upon us,</hi> when the <hi>power</hi> of Chriſt <hi>acts</hi> us and <hi>carries</hi> us forth in difficult duties and ſervices. Chriſt hath promiſed, that his <hi>Spirit</hi> ſhall be in the heart of his people, John 14.16. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;</hi> and in the latter end of the next verſe, it is ſaid, <hi>He dwelleth with you, and ſhall be in you.</hi> How ſhall it be <hi>in them?</hi> It ſhall be <hi>in them,</hi> to <hi>act them.</hi> When
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:64024:166"/>we find the preſence of the ſpirit of Chriſt to act us in a <hi>ſenſible manner,</hi> then is the <hi>power of Chriſt ſaid to reſt upon us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here it may be ſaid,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> how may we do to attain to this? to have the power of Chriſt to reſt upon us? for this is a deſirable thing to feel the power of Chriſt to <hi>reſt</hi> upon us. This was ſo deſirable a thing to <hi>Paul,</hi> that he could <hi>glory in reproaches, neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>perſecutions,</hi> becauſe by this means he had more experience of Chriſts power reſting upon him. <hi>Paul</hi> was contented to undergo the greateſt difficulties, afflictions and hardſhips, ſo that he might have experience of Chriſts power reſting on him. And why is it ſo deſirable a thing to feel Chriſts power reſting upon us? The reaſon is, becauſe every <hi>approach of God,</hi> and every <hi>manifeſtation</hi> of the <hi>Divine preſence</hi> is moſt precious to the <hi>Saints.</hi> Now when the <hi>Saints</hi> have experience of <hi>Chriſts power reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> on them, they are moſt ſenſible of Gods approaches to them; when Chriſts power reſts upon them, it is a <hi>manifeſtation</hi> of <hi>Gods preſence</hi> in them,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:64024:166"/>and what can be more deſirable to a holy ſoul, than to have ſome experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that God and Chriſt dwell in them?</p>
               <p>How then may we attain to this, that the power of Chriſt may reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us?</p>
               <p n="1">1. We muſt carry a deep ſenſe of our infirmitie,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> the ſenſe of our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity makes way for the manifeſtation of Chriſts power, this we have heard already, when <hi>we are weak in our ſelves</hi> then have we moſt experience of Chriſts ſtrength, <hi>When I am weak, then am I ſtrong,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> he that would have experience of Chriſts ſtrength muſt be reduced to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingneſs in himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

                  <hi>Abide in me, and I in you;</hi> the promiſe of <hi>Chriſts abiding in us,</hi> is made upon our <hi>abiding in him,</hi> we cannot expect Chriſt ſhould abide in us by way of <hi>gracious influence,</hi> unleſs we abide in him in a way of <hi>depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</hi>

               <p>HAving ſhewed the <hi>excellency</hi> of <hi>divine</hi> Grace, I ſhall now take occaſion from this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſpeak ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of Divine Grace, and the <hi>ſenſe</hi> which the Saints have of the need they have of the help of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace. I take it for a certain Truth, that the elder we grow in Chriſtianity the more ſenſible ſhall we be of the need we have of Grace. Younger Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may be carryed out much in the heat and ſtrength of their affections, but el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſtians do eaſily perceive the need they have of Divine Grace. We have here the <hi>profeſſion</hi> of the whole <hi>Church,</hi> ſhe profeſſeth the need that ſhe hath of Grace, and therefore prays for it, <hi>Draw me, we will run after thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Her <hi>petition</hi> ſuppoſeth <hi>her want,</hi> ſhe
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:64024:168"/>prays to be <hi>drawn,</hi> wherefore ſhe <hi>needs</hi> to be <hi>drawn, Draw me, we will run after thee;</hi> ſhe plainly intimates that unleſs ſhe were <hi>drawn,</hi> ſhe could not <hi>run.</hi> So that in theſe words, here is a plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the ſenſe that the Church had of the need of Divine Grace. Her praying that ſhe might be drawn by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace, ſuppoſeth that ſhe needed Divine Grace to draw her, and her ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Draw me, and we will run after thee,</hi> plainly ſhews that unleſs ſhe had Divine Grace to draw her, ſhe could not run.</p>
               <p>In the words of the Text there are theſe three things to be conſidered, one whereof is ſuppoſed and the other two are implyed.</p>
               <p>That which is <hi>ſuppoſed,</hi> is the <hi>need</hi> which the Church had of the drawings of Divine Grace, and the <hi>ſenſe</hi> that ſhe had of the need of theſe drawings, <hi>Draw me, we will run after thee.</hi> Her <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to be <hi>drawn,</hi> ſuppoſeth her <hi>need</hi> to be drawn, for we are not wont to pray for that which we do not want. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Church pray to be drawn, ſhe <hi>needs</hi> to be drawn. This is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore implyed, the Churches want of Divine Grace, and the ſenſe that
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:64024:169"/>ſhe had of the want of this Grace.</p>
               <p>There are two things expreſt in the Text:
<list>
                     <item>1. The Churches <hi>petition, Draw me.</hi> The</item>
                     <item>2. Is the <hi>conſequent</hi> of granting this her petition, <hi>Draw me, and we will run after thee.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>There are three Obſervations or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines that do ariſe out of the words. The</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Is this, That <hi>holy Souls are moſt ſenſible of the need which they have of the help of Divine Grace.</hi> This is clearly implyed here, when the Church prays, <hi>Draw me;</hi> ſhe was deeply ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the need ſhe had to be drawn; how drawn? drawn by Divine Grace. The</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. Second Obſervation is <hi>That the ſenſe which we have of the need of Divine Grace ſhould make us pray ſo much the more for the drawings of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace.</hi> The</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. Third and laſt Obſervation is this, <hi>The end why we ſhould deſire the drawings of Divine Grace, it is that our
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:64024:169"/>hearts may be more carryed out after God. Draw me, and we will run after thee.</hi> The end why ſhe deſired to be drawn, was that her heart might be the more carryed out after Chriſt. Theſe are the Obſervations that lie plainly in the Text.</p>
               <p>I ſhall begin to ſpeak a little of the</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of theſe, <hi>holy ſouls are moſt ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the need which they have of the help of Divine Grace.</hi> In ſpeaking to this point there are two or three things to be ſpoken unto.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To ſhew you <hi>what</hi> that <hi>grace</hi> is that holy ſouls are ſenſible of a want, and conſtant need of in themſelves. And,</item>
                  <item>2. What that <hi>ſenſe</hi> is that holy ſouls have of the need and want of Divine Grace. And then,</item>
                  <item>3. The reaſons of it.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>What</hi> that <hi>grace</hi> is which holy ſouls are ſenſible of the need of.</p>
               <p>I ſhall open this in ſeveral particulars, and the more experience we have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto, the more ſhall we underſtand the things that are ſet before us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Saints are ſenſible of the want of <hi>quickening</hi> or <hi>exciting grace;</hi> this is <hi>primarily</hi> intended in the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:64024:170"/>Text, <hi>Draw me, we will run after thee,</hi> why doth the Church pray to be drawn? this is implyed, that ſhe found her ſelf very <hi>dead, heavy,</hi> and <hi>lumpiſh</hi> in the waies of God, ſhe found her heart very unapt to move towards Chriſt, therefore it is that ſhe prays to be drawn, <hi>draw me,</hi> that is, quicken me by <hi>exciting grace,</hi> I find my heart very dead, I find my Spirit lumpiſh, heavy, unapt to move towards thee, therefore quicken me by exciting grace. She was ſenſible ſhe could not move towards Chriſt till ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing grace did quicken her. Holy ſouls are ſenſible of many <hi>damps</hi> and <hi>dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> and <hi>indiſpoſitions</hi> that come upon them, they have not that <hi>quickneſs, live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> and <hi>fervour</hi> in the waies of God, that ſometime they have felt. The more experience we have of our own hearts, the more we ſhall be ſenſible of theſe damps and deadneſſes and indiſpoſitions that art apt to come upon us, and if we are not ſenſible of theſe things it is a ſign we are not acquainted with our own hearts. <hi>David</hi> prays often in the 119. <hi>Pſalm</hi> for <hi>quickening, Quicken me, quicken me,</hi> in ſeveral places of that <hi>Pſalm;</hi> hence may we gather that he found a great deal of ſpiritual deadneſs
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:64024:170"/>that was come upon him. Do not we often find an indiſpoſition to <hi>prayer,</hi> to <hi>meditation,</hi> to <hi>holy conference,</hi> oh then do we need <hi>quickening grace,</hi> then do we need to pray as the Church doth here, <hi>draw us,</hi> when we find our hearts dead and lumpiſh in the waies of God, then do we need quickening or exciting Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Holy Souls are oftentimes ſenſible of the want of <hi>elevating grace</hi> to <hi>raiſe</hi> and <hi>elevate</hi> their hearts to God. This alſo is in the Text, <hi>Draw me, we will run after thee.</hi> The Church was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that ſhe could not <hi>get up</hi> her heart to God as ſhe would have it carried up to him. <hi>Draw me,</hi> ſhe would fain get an advance towards God, but ſhe could not get up her Spirit to him as ſhe would. She had not thoſe <hi>inlarged af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> towards God as ſometimes ſhe had, and therefore ſhe prays to be drawn. Conſider it well, do you not ſometimes find your affections very <hi>flat</hi> and <hi>low</hi> to what they are at other times; either your affections ſtick in ſome lower infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour things, or elſe there is ſuch a <hi>clog,</hi> a <hi>weight</hi> that lies upon them, that you cannot get them to aſcend to God. O how ſeldom is it that we can get our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:64024:171"/>upon the wing to mount up and ſoar aloft towards God! our affections flag and ſink, and it is well ſometimes if we can tell whether we have any affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for God yea or no. Sometimes it may be we ſhall find our hearts carryed up aloft, above the <hi>Sphear</hi> of all <hi>created things,</hi> we ſhall find we love God <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably</hi> above all things here below, at other times we find our hearts lumpiſh and heavy like a piece of <hi>lead,</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get them to aſcend to God, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they do, therefore the Saints do want elevating grace, to elevate and raiſe their hearts to God: The Saints find the need of Divine Grace to elevate their hearts above <hi>preſent things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is natural to us to ſtick in <hi>preſent things,</hi> in things that are <hi>ſeen,</hi> and the Saints that have acquaintance with their own hearts, find they have need of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace to elevate their hearts above the things that are ſeen, to the inviſible God. Unleſs <hi>divine</hi> grace <hi>raiſe</hi> us we ſhall ſink into preſent ſenſible things and cannot get up above them. It is only Divine Grace that raiſes us above pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Saints are ſenſible of the need they have of <hi>corroborating</hi> or <hi>ſtengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                  <pb n="331" facs="tcp:64024:171"/>Grace and that in theſe three parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They ſee the need of <hi>ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> grace to carry them through the <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties</hi> of their Pilgrimage here on earth. The <hi>elder</hi> the Saints grow, the greater and ſorer are their difficulties ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times. God puts his people to the hardeſt leſſons at laſt oftentimes, and <hi>el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſtians</hi> are more ſenſible of the need of Divine grace to carry them through the difficulties of their Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. So great are their tryals and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties ſometimes, that they meet with, that they are ready to faint under them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.14. <hi>Wait on the Lord, be of good courage and he ſhall ſtrengthen thine heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why is this ſpoken, but only to ſhew us that the Saints are oftentimes reduced to ſuch a caſe and condition, as that they had need to be bid to take heart and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to themſelves, they are apt to deſpond and ſink in their ſpirits through their own infirmities, and the greatneſs of their tryals that come upon them, they are apt to caſt away their hope, and therefore they need Divine Grace to <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> their hearts; and the Lord here promiſeth that he will do it, <hi>Wait
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:64024:172"/>on the Lord, be of good courage, and he ſhall ſtrengthen thy heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Saints find by experience hat their hearts are apt to deſpond within them, when their difficulties are <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>renewed</hi> upon them, and they have need to pray for corroborating Grace to fortifie and bear them up againſt the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties they meet withal.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are ſenſible of the need of corroborating and ſtrengthening Grace to <hi>ſupport</hi> them under their <hi>ſorrows and afflictions,</hi> Pſal. 119.28. <hi>My ſoul melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away for heavineſs, ſtrengthen thou me according to thy Word.</hi> In the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal it is, <hi>My ſoul droppeth,</hi> that is, it is ready to die and faint away under my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, therefore <hi>ſtrengthen me accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thy Word,</hi> unleſs thy Grace ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and uphold me, my ſoul will drop and melt away under my afflictions, my afflictions will be too hard for me, and ſink me quite and clean, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.116. <hi>Uphold me that I may live,</hi> when a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is juſt ready to ſink and faint away, unleſs there be one near to uphold him, he muſt needs fall to the ground. This holy man ſpeaks here after this rate, I am juſt <hi>fainting</hi> away, <hi>uphold me that I may live.</hi> The Children of God find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:64024:172"/>even fainting and dying away un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their afflictions and preſſures, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they find the need of upholding Grace, or elſe they muſt ſink and periſh. Thoſe that are at eaſe know not the meaning of theſe things, but exerciſed ſouls know the meaning of them. Thoſe that have been under Temptations know what <hi>David</hi> means when he ſaith, <hi>My ſoul melteth away for heavineſs,</hi> and <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold me that I may live.</hi> Without Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace the Saints would ſink and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in their afflictions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are ſenſible of the need of <hi>ſtrengthening Grace</hi> to carry them out in the <hi>performance</hi> of <hi>duty, To will is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with me,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>but how to perform I know not,</hi> Rom. 7.18. Holy ſouls find a mind and will to do many things, but how to do them and perform them <hi>actually</hi> they know not, they would fain deny themſelves, they would fain bring their will to Gods Will without the leaſt reluctance. They would fain Pray better, and Hear better, but when it comes to <hi>perform,</hi> they find they are very ſhort, and they find the need of Divine Grace to help them to perform what they will to do. It is a great Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.35. <hi>Make me to go
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:64024:173"/>in the path of thy commandments, for therein do I delight.</hi> His delight was in the waies of God, yea but for all that he needed Grace to make him to walk in them, and therefore he prays, <hi>Make me to go.</hi> It may be we can ſay we have a delight to <hi>pray,</hi> a delight to <hi>hear,</hi> a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to <hi>meditate,</hi> but for all this, we need <hi>actual aſſiſting grace</hi> to inable us to <hi>pray,</hi> and to inable us to <hi>hear,</hi> and to inable us to <hi>meditate, Make me to go in the path of thy Commandments, for therein do I delight.</hi> Though he delighted in Gods Commandments, yet he wanted Grace to make him to <hi>go</hi> in them. Though we have a love and affection to holy duties, yet we want Divine Grace and aſſiſtance to carry us out in the performance of thoſe holy duties that we love.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Saints are ſenſible of the need they have of <hi>mollifying grace</hi> to <hi>ſoften</hi> and <hi>break</hi> their hearts, this is the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.17. <hi>Lord why haſt thou har dened our hearts from thy fear;</hi> the Church here complains of her <hi>hardneſs,</hi> ſhe is ſenſible of the need of <hi>mollifying</hi> Grace. Holy ſouls are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of much <hi>hardneſs</hi> and <hi>unbrokenneſs</hi> of ſpirit. It is a great trouble to them oftentimes that they cannot find their
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:64024:173"/>hearts break and melt for ſin as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they have done. Is it not a great trouble to you Chriſtians to find theſe changes? You have found your hearts melt and break, now you cannot find them breaking and melting as heretofore. It is the Promiſe of the <hi>Covenant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 36.26.</note> 
                  <hi>I will take away the heart of ſtone, and give a heart of fleſh.</hi> Now if it be the work of Divine Grace to take away the heart of ſtone (as certain it is (there is much of that heart of ſtone remaining in us any further than Divine Grace is put forth in us to ſoften our hearts) then the Saints want mollifying Grace to break their hearts under the ſenſe of ſin. Sometimes a little ſin will break our hearts and affect our conſciences, at other times a greater ſin will not do it, therefore we want Divine Grace to make our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences <hi>tender</hi> at all times.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Saints are ſenſible of the need of <hi>medicinal</hi> or <hi>bealing grace</hi> to heal the malignity and perverſeneſs which they find lurking in their natures. There is a root of <hi>pride,</hi> of <hi>paſſion,</hi> of <hi>envy,</hi> a root of <hi>frowardneſs</hi> and <hi>diſcontent,</hi> a root of <hi>murmuring</hi> and <hi>impatience,</hi> a root of <hi>covetouſneſs,</hi> which lurks in all our hearts, and the more experience we
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:64024:174"/>have of our own hearts, the more need we ſhall ſee we have of the Grace of God to heal theſe roots of ſin that are thus lurking in us, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 41.4. <hi>Heal my ſoul for I have ſinned againſt thee.</hi> We read of <hi>Ephraim</hi> that there was a root of <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs</hi> and <hi>forwardneſs</hi> in him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.17. <hi>For the iniquity of his covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was I wroth,</hi> there was <hi>one evil,</hi> viz. covetouſneſs, <hi>I hid me and was wroth,</hi> and he went on <hi>frowardly</hi> in the way of his heart, there is <hi>another evil</hi> added to it, <hi>viz.</hi> frowardneſs and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs of ſpirit, his heart was very much out of frame, what doth God ſay? <hi>I have ſeen his waies and will heal him.</hi> When our hearts are froward and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, nothing but Divine Grace can ſet our hearts right.</p>
               <p>We have many ſuch roots of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in us, Pride, Paſſion, Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Envy, Frowardneſs, Diſcontent, Murmuring, Impatience, and the like. Now we need Divine Grace, medicinal Grace to heal us.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Saints are ſenſible of the need which they have of <hi>powerful efficacious grace</hi> to cauſe them to <hi>believe</hi> in Chriſt. <hi>Draw me,</hi> that is; draw me to thy ſelf in a way of believing; ſo ſome expound
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:64024:174"/>it, and they compare this Text with thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44. <hi>No man can come to me, except the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which ſent me, draw him.</hi> There muſt be the drawing of Divine Grace before any perſon can come to Chriſt in a way of believing, ſo that we need ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious Grace to draw us to come to Chriſt in a way of believing. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we may think, there is naturally an oppoſition in our hearts againſt the way of believing. It is natural to every man to ſeek for a righteouſneſs in himſelf. We were all born under the Covenant of Works, and we deſire to live and abide under the Covenant of Works, and ſeek for a righteouſneſs of our own, This is plain from that of the Jews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. <hi>They being ignorant of Gods rightcouſneſs,</hi> and what is this righteouſneſs of God? imputed righteouſneſs, the <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of God</hi> by Faith, as the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Now,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they being ignorant of Gods righteouſneſs, went about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs.</hi> It is natural to every man to ſeek for a righteouſneſs in himſelf, and he is loth to be beholding to the righteouſneſs of another, ſo <hi>proud</hi> is the heart of man that he would not go out of himſelf for
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:64024:175"/>happineſs, therefore it is the power of Divine Grace that muſt take a man out of himſelf and from off his own bottom, to make him come to Chriſt. And as we need Divine Grace to help us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve firſt of all, ſo we need the help of the ſame Grace to inable us to put forth every <hi>particular act</hi> of Faith. We have a clear Text for it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. <hi>Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, in believing,</hi> that is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But how ſo? <hi>Through the power of the Holy Ghoſt; to the end that ye may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> mark it, it is by the power of the Holy Ghoſt that we muſt abound in the acts of Faith, we cannot put forth one act of Faith without the power and ſpecial helps and aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt. Do we not find it a difficult thing to come to the ſpiritual apprehenſions of Chriſt? how hard do we find it to apprehend the perſon of Chriſt aright? how difficult is it to have right conceptions of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and of the Grace of Chriſt? Now Faith begins in the ſpiritual appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.40. <hi>This is the Will of him that ſent me, that every
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:64024:175"/>one which ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlaſting life.</hi> There muſt be firſt <hi>ſeeing</hi> of the Son before there can be believing on him. <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual apprehenſion</hi> of Chriſt is the firſt thing in Faith, there muſt firſt be a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual apprehenſion of Chriſt before there can be an act of Faith upon Chriſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paul</hi> prays that he might <hi>know Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 3.10. That I may <hi>know him,</hi> &amp;c. Now if we cannot ſo eaſily come to ſpiritual apprehenſions of Chriſt, it is not ſo eaſie to act Faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as we may think. Therefore the Saints need the power of efficacious Grace to cauſe them to believe; and the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. latter end, That there is the ſame power put forth to make us to believe, as was put forth by God when he raiſed Chriſt from the dead.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Saints are ſenſible of the need that they have of <hi>preparing</hi> or diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Grace, if I may ſo call it, to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, incline,</hi> and <hi>diſpoſe</hi> their hearts to the things of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Thou wilt prepare their hearts to pray, thou wilt cauſe thine car to hear. Thou will prepare their hearts to pray.</hi> It is God that prepares the heart to <hi>pray;</hi> ſo in

                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.39. <hi>Incline my heart to thy Teſtimonies.</hi> The Saints are ſenſible of the need of the Grace of God to put a <hi>new bent,</hi> a <hi>new bias</hi> on their hearts. <hi>Incline my heart to thy Teſtimonies;</hi> our hearts are oftentimes out of frame, very much <hi>unſuited</hi> to ſpiritual things, and holy ſouls are ſenſible of the need of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace to bring them into frame, to diſpoſe them and bring them into a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per fit for the duties God calls them to, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.20, 21. <hi>The God of peace make you perfect in every good work,</hi> that is, <hi>adapt, frame, diſpoſe</hi> you to every good work. Oh the more experience we have of our own hearts, the more need we ſhall find we have of Divine Grace to bring our hearts into frame, and keep them in frame.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Saints are ſenſible of the need they have of <hi>over-powering</hi> and <hi>conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Grace to conquer and overcome the reluctancy that is in their wills againſt the Divine Will. When Gods Will thwarts and croſſes our wills, our wills are apt to reluctate and make head againſt Gods Will, therefore holy ſouls are ſenſible of the need of Grace to overcome that rebellion and oppoſition that is in their wills againſt the Divine
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:64024:176"/>Will. O it is the mighty power of the Grace of God that makes a man lay aſide his own will, and his own <hi>private affections;</hi> nothing but Grace can make a man do this, every man by nature is wedded to his own will, and nothing but the Grace of God can take a man off from his own private will, and his own private affection. When our Saviour had foretold his ſufferings, <hi>Peter</hi> could not bear this, his will began to reluctate, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.22. <hi>Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, ſaying, Be it far from thee; Lord, this ſhall not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee.</hi> When Gods Will thwarts ours, our wills are apt preſently to rebel, and to make head againſt it: Therefore ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſouls are ſenſible of the need of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace to overcome the reluctancy that they find in their wills againſt the Will of God.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Saints are ſenſible of the need of <hi>preſerving</hi> Grace to preſerve and keep them from falling into <hi>groſs</hi> and <hi>ſcandalous</hi> ſins, <hi>Jude</hi> verſ. 24. <hi>To him that is able to keep you from falling, falling,</hi> how? <hi>falling foully,</hi> falling <hi>ſcandalouſly.</hi> It is God that is <hi>able</hi> to keep us from falling, we are not <hi>able</hi> to keep our ſelves. It is the Divine power
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:64024:177"/>that keeps us from falling foully and ſcandalouſly, we cannot keep our ſelves. We have another Saint profeſſing his inability in this point, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.5. <hi>Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps ſlip not;</hi> as much as if he ſhould ſay, I ſhall ſoon tread awry, I ſhall eaſily be overtaken by ſome groſs ſin, if thou doſt not uphold me, if thou doſt not keep me. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.13. <hi>Keep back thy ſervant from preſumptuous ſins,</hi> as much as if he ſhould ſay, I am prone enough of my ſelf to fall into <hi>preſumptuous ſins,</hi> it is thy grace alone can keep me back from them. Alas, if we ſhould truſt to our own ſtrength we ſhould ſoon find how weak it is; there is not the holieſt ſoul, but would fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſcandalous ſins, did not Divine Grace keep him.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And laſtly, The Saints are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the need they have of <hi>fixing</hi> and <hi>eſtabliſhing</hi> Grace to keep their hearts <hi>fixt</hi> and <hi>conſtant</hi> in the waies of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.11. <hi>unite my heart to fear thy name; unite my heart,</hi> when this holy man prays to have his heart <hi>united,</hi> that ſhews he found his heart prone to many <hi>excurſions,</hi> his affections were ſcattered abroad unto variety of objects, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth he pray to have his heart <hi>united</hi>
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:64024:177"/>to God, that ſo he might adhere to God <hi>only, firmly, inſeparably, truly.</hi> It is very hard for us to keep our hearts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies cloſe to God, every poor thing is apt to diſtract them and turn them aſide, therefore holy ſouls, that walk with God, ſee a neceſſity of Divine Grace to fix their hearts, that they may cleave to the Lord firmly and inſeparably.</p>
               <p>Is it ſo,<note place="margin">uſe <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> that <hi>holy ſouls</hi> are moſt ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the need they have of Divine Grace? hence may we learn, that they who magnifie and cry up the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> and mans <hi>free will,</hi> and <hi>decry</hi> the neceſſity of Divine Grace do little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand their own hearts, and the reaſon is, becauſe this crying up of the power of nature and mans own ability and ſtrength, is manifeſtly contrary to the experience of the Saints in all ages, therefore it was well obſerved by one, That the principles of ſome men, who do cry up Free-will, they are contrary to the <hi>common ſenſe</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> of all the faithful. Some men teach us that we have a power to believe: the Saints experience in all ages tells them that they have no power. Certainly <hi>Paul</hi> had as much of the power of Free-will in him as another man, and yet he ſaith,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:64024:178"/>
                  <hi>We have not ſufficiency of our ſelves to think a good thought,</hi> what leſs than a holy thought? and yet we have no leſs than an Apoſtle, after all the Grace he had received, that tells us, that he had not ſufficiency of himſelf to think a good thought. Some men make their boaſt of their own ſtrength and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, but how contrary is this to the language of the Saints in Scripture? The Saints with one accord in Scripture cry out, <hi>Draw us, quicken us, incline us, unite our hearts, order our ſteps in thy waies,</hi> what are all theſe expreſſions but a holy confeſſion of their own inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency? therefore they who cry up the power of nature and mans Free-will are not to be credited in what they ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is contrary to the ſenſe and <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage</hi> of the Church in all Ages.</p>
               <p>This ſhould teach us in the</p>

                  </note> Place <hi>great humility;</hi> If the Church here prays to be <hi>drawn,</hi> Oh then let us all labour to be ſenſible of the need we have of Divine Grace. The more ſenſible we are of the need of <hi>grace,</hi> the more humble ſhall we be in our ſelves, the greater dependance ſhall we have upon Chriſt, the more ſhall we ſeek to God for Grace, and the more we
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:64024:178"/>ſhall give to God the glory of the Grace which we receive from him: whereas on the contrary, the more we abound in the ſenſe of our own <hi>fullneſs</hi> and <hi>ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,</hi> and the leſs ſenſe we have of our need of Divine Grace, the more liable we are to fall. Take it for a certain truth, that none are more likely to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted of God, and left to themſelves than thoſe who are preſumptuous of their own ſtrength, and unſenſible of the need they have of Divine Grace, for God <hi>reſiſts the proud, and gives grace to the humble,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.5. When we do not keep up the ſenſe of our need of Grace, then God leaves us to our ſelves, and ſhews us what we are, and what we can do, or rather what we cannot do, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of Divine Grace, and God leaving us to fall one way or other, makes us ſee what need we have of his Grace. Therefore as we would not have God deſert us, and leave us to our ſelves, let us keep up a conſtant ſenſe of the need of his Grace; and that no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

We preſume upon our own gifts and Grace received, upon our own ſufficiency and reſolution, and are not ſenſible of our need of Grace for every thing, and hence it is that we go forth in the confidence of our own ſtrength and ability, and neglect our dependance on Chriſt, and then we have experience oftentimes how greatly we miſcarry. But we ſhall find it to be true, that our greateſt perfection lies in this, to go intirely out of our ſelves, and to have the moſt intire dependance upon God for every thing; the higheſt perfection a Chriſtian can attain to in this life, is to go wholly out of himſelf, and to have an intire dependance upon God for every thing.</p>

               <p>I Now proceed to the ſecond thing, and that is, to ſhew what the ſenſe is the Saints have of their need of <hi>divine grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall but touch upon this in a few words, and then come to the reaſons, to ſhew, How it comes to paſs that holy ſouls have this <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the need of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What that <hi>ſenſe</hi> is that the Saints have of their need of Divine Grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They have an <hi>awakened</hi> and <hi>live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> ſenſe of their need of Grace. The experience they have of their own hearts makes them to ſee their need of the Grace of God. They find by ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that they are overtaken by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſins contrary to the deliberate purpoſe of their wills; they find alſo they come very ſhort of doing and performing that
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:64024:180"/>good they have a mind to do and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, <hi>To will is preſent with me, but how to perform that which is good, I find not,</hi> ſaies <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. Now this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection the Saints have into their hearts and lives, keeps up in them an awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſenſe of the need which they have of Divine Grace. The ſad experience of what they find and feel in themſelves, will not ſuffer them to be ignorant of the need of Divine Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As they have an awakened and lively ſenſe of the need of Divine Grace, ſo they have a continued ſenſe of the need of Divine Grace. The ſenſe of the need they have of the help of Grace it runs throughout their whole lives; the elder any one grows in <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> the more experience he hath attained unto, the more ſenſible he will be of his need of Divine Grace.<note place="margin">De Bono Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verantiae.</note> 
                  <hi>Auſtin</hi> after he had written many Books concerning the Grace of God, one of his laſt Books was concerning the <hi>good</hi> of <hi>perſeverance.</hi> The Saints after they have received much Grace from God, yet they are ſenſible they need this Grace alſo, that they may perſevere and hold out to the end.</p>
               <p>We come now to the grounds of the Point.</p>
               <pb n="349" facs="tcp:64024:180"/>
               <p>How is it that the Saints have this <hi>ſenſe</hi> in themſelves, this <hi>awakened ſenſe,</hi> this <hi>continued ſenſe</hi> of the need of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace, what are the Reaſons of it?</p>
               <p>There are three or four Reaſons to be given of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Saints are ſenſible of a <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> of <hi>ſin</hi> within them,<note place="margin">1. Reaſon the Saints have of the ſenſe of the need of Divine Grace.</note> 
                  <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death,</hi> and it is <hi>ſin that dwelleth in me,</hi> Rom. 7.20. Now the Saints being ſo ſenſible of original ſin that dwelleth in them, are alſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that this evil root that is within them, is apt to betray them upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. <hi>In me, that is, in my fleſh dwelleth no good thing,</hi> Rom. 7.18. Corrupt nature that is in us will never <hi>incline</hi> us to good: But it is prone enough to incline us to evil. When Temptations from without are wanting, our own hearts are prone enough to tempt us to evil, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14. <hi>But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own luſt, and inticed.</hi> If there were no tempter from without, there is corruption enough in every one of our hearts to ſeduce us to ſin. Now the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience which the Saints have of the treachery and deceitfulneſs of their own
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:64024:181"/>hearts, this makes them to ſee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant need which they have of Divine Grace.<note place="margin">Jer. 17.9.</note> 
                  <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doth the <hi>deceitfulneſs</hi> of the heart diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it ſelf? Truely, among other things the <hi>deceitfulneſs</hi> of the heart diſcovers it ſelf in this, that when ſin ſeems to be faſt aſleep, when it doth not ſtir at all, when it ſeems to be as a thing dead and extinct, yet upon the leaſt occaſion it awakens and puts it ſelf forth again with freſh life and vigour. Now this proclivity and readineſs that is in the heart to ſin, that upon every occaſion the heart is apt to bend and incline towards ſin, this makes the Saints ſenſible of the conſtant need they have of Divine Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the Saints are ſenſible of a <hi>fountain of ſin</hi> in them,<note place="margin">2. Reaſon the Saints have of the ſenſe of the need of Divine Grace.</note> ſo they are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible how unable they are to withſtand the <hi>impetuous motions</hi> of coruption that ariſe from the root of ſin in them. Oh do we not find oftentimes corrupt nature to bear us down like a mighty Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent? When the Lord reproved <hi>Jonah</hi> for his <hi>peeviſhneſs</hi> and <hi>fretfulneſs</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the <hi>gourd, Doſt thou well to be angry?</hi> what doth <hi>Jonah</hi> anſwer, <hi>I do
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:64024:181"/>well to be angry to the very death.</hi> Here was a <hi>Prophet,</hi> no leſs than a Prophet blown up by a paſſion, yea by a paſſion for a very little thing, as we would think, ſuch are we when we are left by Divine Grace. How often is it thus with us that ſome violent affection hurries us, and tranſports us beyond all bounds, a poor paſſion blows us up, and we know not how to withſtand it: this makes the Saints ſee their daily need of Divine Grace; unleſs Divine Grace ſet bounds to our paſſions and affections, whither will our paſſions and affections hurry us? Now the experience the Saints have of the impetuous motions of ſin within them, this makes them ſee their need of Divine Grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Saints are ſenſible of their <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency</hi> and <hi>utter inability</hi> of themſelves to <hi>do</hi> any thing that is <hi>good,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. Reaſon the Saints have of the ſenſe of the need of Divine Grace.</note> 2 Cor. 3.5. <hi>Not that we are ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing, but our ſufficiency is of God.</hi> Holy ſouls find by experience that they cannot command <hi>good thoughts</hi> or <hi>holy affections.</hi> Is it not thus with you ſometimes? do not you ſay in the ſecret retirements of your ſouls, O that it were with me as in the daies of old, O that it were with me as ſometimes it was, O
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:64024:182"/>that I had ſuch apprehenſions of God, ſuch affections towards God as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I had! Now the Saints finding by experience that they cannot command holy thoughts and holy affections, nor perform any thing that is ſpiritually good, this ſenſe of their own <hi>impotency,</hi> makes them ſee their need of Divine Grace.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly,<note place="margin">4. Reaſon the Saints have of the ſenſe of the need of Divine Grace.</note> The Saints have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of very <hi>different frames</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when they are acted by Divine Grace, and when they are left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>When they are acted by Divine Grace, then they get above this world, then they can mount up aloft, then they can delight themſelves greatly in God, then they can take up their reſt and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in God; But at other times when they are left to themſelves, and Divine Grace doth not ſo act them and aſſiſt them, they experience no ſuch thing, but on the contrary they find their hearts flat, dead, carnal, and too like to other men, groveling in this world: this is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence holy ſouls find in themſelves, and all is according to the acceſſes and receſſes of Divine Grace. Now the Saints find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is not at all times alike with
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:64024:182"/>them, but that it is far otherwiſe with them when they are acted and aſſiſted by Divine Grace, and when they have not the ſame aſſiſtance of Divine Grace, this makes them ſee their conſtant need of the Grace of God.</p>
               <p>And ſo I have done with the doctrinal part: I come now to the Uſe and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
               <p>This is matter of <hi>Reproof</hi> to us that we are no more ſenſible of the need of Divine Grace;<note place="margin">Uſe <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> we have a <hi>ſelf-fulneſs,</hi> a <hi>ſelf-ſufficiency,</hi> we do not ſee the conſtant need we have of the Grace of God. Happy ſoul is he that ſeeth his conſtant need of Grace; but I am afraid there are few ſuch to be found. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians, Ye are full, ye are rich, ye have reigned as Kings,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. that is, ye are ſo in your own conceits, and apprehenſions; it was not really ſo, but in their own opinion and conceit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning themſelves. Thus it is with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Profeſſors, they are <hi>full,</hi> they are rich, they are Kings in their own apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they are come to the <hi>top</hi> of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</hi> But it is much to be feared that mens greateſt <hi>ſuppoſed perfection</hi> will be found to be their <hi>greateſt imperfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Certainly holy men that have walked
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:64024:183"/>with God, have counted it their greate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt perfection to ſee their need of the Grace of God. But alas we ſee no ſuch need of Grace; we think we are full, we are apt to think we have all that need be deſired. It was the charge which Chriſt brought againſt the Church of <hi>Laodicea, Rev.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Thou ſayeſt, I am rich and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed with good, and have need of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> O but it was but her <hi>ſaying</hi> ſo, it was not really ſo, for whereas ſhe ſaid ſhe was <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>increaſed</hi> with goods and <hi>wanted nothing,</hi> ſhe was indeed really <hi>poor,</hi> and <hi>blind,</hi> and <hi>wretched,</hi> and <hi>miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi> and <hi>naked,</hi> ſo our Saviour tells her. Such is our <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>ſelf-conceit,</hi> that when we are moſt <hi>poor,</hi> we then think our ſelves to be moſt rich, and when we want all things, we think we abound in all things.</p>
               <p>But how doth it appear that we have not a due <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the want of Divine Grace?</p>
               <p>There are two or three demonſtrations that may evince and make it clear to us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we are apt to preſume much, and have high conceits of our own <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments,</hi> Gal. 6.3. <hi>If any man think himſelf</hi> ſomething, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2. <hi>If a man think he knoweth any thing.</hi> We are
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:64024:183"/>apt to think that we have attained much, that we are very <hi>knowing perſons,</hi> that little more can be added to us than we do know, than what we have received. Now theſe high conceits of our ſelves, are a certain ſign of our ſelf-fulneſs, and that we do not ſee our need of Divine Grace. He that thinks that he is well ſtored al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, he that thinks he hath proviſion enough of his own, will never be a <hi>beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> at the door of Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A clearer demonſtration yet is this, that we feel ſo little of a <hi>ſpiritual hunger</hi> and <hi>thirſt</hi> in our ſouls after Grace. The ſenſe of want cauſeth hunger and begets thirſt. Hunger and thirſt do properly ariſe from the ſenſe of want. When na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſenſible of ſome want, this cauſeth hunger and thirſt. Now that we do not feel our ſouls <hi>prick'd</hi> with a ſpiritual hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt after Grace, it is a ſign we are not ſo ſenſible of our want of Grace as we ought to be, <hi>Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, for they ſhall be filled,</hi> Matth. 5.6. There muſt be a ſpiritual hunger and thirſt after Grace, as ever we expect to receive much Grace; but how little is it of this ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al hunger that we feel in our ſelves? We are ſoon ſenſible of the want of other
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:64024:184"/>things. If our bodies be but a little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered, we are ſoon ſenſible of the want of health; if we are in wants, ſtreights, and neceſſities, we are ſoon ſenſible of the want of ſupplies. O but how rarely are we ſenſible of the want of Divine Grace; of the want of Faith? Faith to believe in Chriſt, Faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Promiſes? How rare is it that we are ſenſible of the want of love to God, of the want of holy affections, of the want of brokenneſs of heart for ſin, hatred againſt ſin? and the like. We have a quick ſenſe of other wants; but is our ſenſe ſo quick when we are under ſpiritual wants? That our hunger and thirſt is no more vehement after Grace, that we feel no more keenneſs and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in our appetites after Divine Grace, it is a certain ſign we are not ſo ſenſible of our need of Grace as we ought to be.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another ſign that we do not find the want of Grace, is, that we do not ſee a greater need of the <hi>ordinances</hi> and of the <hi>means</hi> of Grace. If we ſaw a need of Grace it ſelf, it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, we ſhould ſee a greater need of the means by which God is wont to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey Grace. The ordinances are the <hi>conduit-pipes,</hi> the <hi>ordinary</hi> means, by
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:64024:184"/>which God is wont to convey grace to the ſouls of his people: For, <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing is of the Word of God;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10.17.</note> therefore that we are ſo <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</hi> as to our attendance on the Ordinances, and do not find that <hi>need</hi> of them in our own ſouls, it is a certain ſign we are not ſo ſenſible of the want of divine grace as we ought to be. The <hi>holieſt</hi> men who have had the greateſt ſenſe of their need of grace, have been moſt ſenſible of their need of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to preſerve and keep alive grace within them. Hence is that of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 63.1. <hi>My ſoul thirſteth for thee, my ſoul longeth for thee in a dry and thirſty Land,</hi> why ſo? <hi>That I may ſee thy power and thy glory, ſo as I have ſeen thee in the Sanctuary.</hi> He had found the power of divine grace put forth in his ſoul, in the Ordinances, and that experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he had of the grace of God that had appeared to him in the Ordinances, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him the more to thirſt after them. Holy ſouls ſee a need not of one Ordinance only, but of <hi>every</hi> Ordinance, for they know that there is not any <hi>one</hi> means of grace appointed in vain. I take it for a certain Truth, that ſo far as a man comes up to ſpirituality and to any growth in
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:64024:185"/>Chriſtianity, the more he will ſee his need of <hi>every</hi> Ordinance. There is no Ordinance of God in vain. The infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely wiſe God hath not appointed any one means of grace that our ſouls do not need; therefore holy ſouls ſee their need not only of <hi>ſome</hi> Ordinances, but of <hi>all</hi> the Ordinances; and as they ſee their need of every Ordinance, ſo they ſee their need of the frequent uſe of the Ordinances; and the reaſon is plainly this, the more grace a man hath, the more he is acquainted with the ſtate of his own ſoul, and the more a man is acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the ſtate of his own ſoul, the more he ſees the great defects that are in himſelf, and the ſight of thoſe defects in himſelf makes him prize all the waies and means whereby God is wont to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate grace to his people. This is the true reaſon why holy ſouls ſee their need of the Ordinances. Now that we do not find ſuch an appetite to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, ſo as to bring us to them with that frequency, nor ſuch a reliſh and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in them, when we are preſent at them, it is a certain ſign that we are not ſenſible of the want of grace, and it is our want of a ſenſe of our need of grace that makes us ſo regardleſs of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:64024:185"/>as we are. It is far from an high attainment to ſit looſe to the Ordinances. They who do ſo, and do conſtantly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Ordinances, give too great grounds of ſuſpicion, whether they have any grace or no; for the more grace any man hath, the more he ſeeth his need of all the means of grace.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Uſe is by way of <hi>Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> to <hi>exhort</hi> us to maintain and keep up a deep and conſtant ſenſe of the need we have of <hi>divine</hi> grace. It is the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel which Chriſt gives to the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> Rev. 3.18. <hi>I counſel thee to buy of me Gold tried in the fire, that thou maiſt be rich, and white rayment, that thou maiſt be clothed, that the ſhame of thy nakedneſs do not appear, and anoint thine eye with eye ſalve that thou maiſt ſee.</hi> She thought ſhe was rich and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed with goods and wanted nothing, Chriſt tells her, it was not ſo as ſhe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, but that ſhe was <hi>poor,</hi> and <hi>wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and <hi>miſerable,</hi> and blind, and naked, therefore he exhorts her to keep up a ſenſe of her need of grace, <hi>I counſel thee to buy of me,</hi> &amp;c. That is therefore to be the Exhortation unto us, that we would labour to keep up a conſtant ſenſe of our need of divine grace. Now for
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:64024:186"/>a few <hi>Motives</hi> to quicken us hereunto.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider,<note place="margin">Motive <hi>1</hi>
                  </note> This is the way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare us to receive moſt <hi>grace</hi> from God. The more ſenſible we are of the need of grace,<note place="margin">Luke 1.53.</note> the more are we prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive grace from God. For, <hi>God fills the hungry with good things.</hi> Humility is,<note place="margin">Vas Gratiarum.</note> as one calls it, the <hi>Veſſel</hi> that receives and takes in all other grace; by <hi>humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> we are prepared to receive all other grace at the hand of God. Now Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility ariſeth from a ſenſe of our own wants and indigency, the more ſenſible we are of our own wants and weakneſles, the more humble we ſhall be, and the more humble we are, the more are we prepared to receive divine grace, for <hi>God gives grace to the humble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Motive is this,<note place="margin">Motive <hi>2</hi>
                  </note> Not to be ſenſible of the need of divine grace, is an argument of <hi>great ſecurity;</hi> for what is ſecurity? Security is when a man thiks himſelf free from danger; then is a man ſecure when he is apprehenſive of no danger; now, then is a man in the greateſt danger, when he is leaſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of danger. A man is never in greater danger of falling into ſome groſs and ſcandalous ſin, than when he is moſt ſecule. Our Saviour bids us to <hi>watch
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:64024:186"/>and pray that we enter not into temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> this plainly intimates,<note place="margin">Matth. 26.41.</note> that if we do not <hi>watch</hi> and pray, we may ſoon fall into Temptation; now if we are not ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the need of divine grace, but are ſecure, and think all is well, we ſhall neither <hi>watch</hi> nor <hi>pray,</hi> and ſo, ſoon be ſurprized and overcome by Temptation.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>Motive</hi> is this,<note place="margin">Motive <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> Nothing will <hi>provoke</hi> God ſooner to <hi>deſert</hi> us in point of grace, and to leave us to our ſelves, than for us not to keep up a ſenſe of the need we have of his grace. If we think we have a <hi>ſelf-fulneſs,</hi> and a <hi>ſelf-ſufficiency,</hi> this cauſeth God to leave us to our ſelves, that ſo we may ſee what we are without his grace. We read how God left <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to try <hi>him, that he might know all that was in his heart;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Chron. 32 31.</note> we we do not preſently ſee all that is in our hearts, till God withdraw his grace form us. Am I <hi>a Dog,</hi> ſaid he,<note place="margin">2 Kings 8.13.</note> that I ſhould do ſo and ſo? ſo are we apt to think within our ſelves, is it poſſible that ever I ſhould be inclined to ſuch a ſin and ſuch a corruption? Now when we preſume on our own ſtrength and ſufficiency, the Lord leaves us, and then we ſoon ſee that ſuperfiuity of naughtineſs that is in our hearts, we ſee that ſin in
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:64024:187"/>us that we little thought had been in us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly, That we may keep up the ſenſe of our need of divine grace, Conſider, the more ſenſible we are of the need of grace, the more ſenſible we ſhall be of the help and aſſiſtance of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace when God affords it to us, and ſo God will have the glory of his own grace. Gods deſign is to have the glory of his grace in all things. Now the more ſenſible we are of the want of grace, the more ſenſible we ſhall be of the help and aſſiſtance of divine grace when God affords it to us.</p>
               <p>But here it may be inquired, What ought we to do that we may keep up a conſtant ſenſe of the need of divine grace? I ſhall propound a few means to help us herein.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Would we ſee the need of divine grace, let us be much converſant in the <hi>ſtudy</hi> of our own hearts. The work of <hi>a Chriſtian</hi> lies <hi>mainly</hi> and <hi>principally</hi> in two things, In the <hi>ſtudy</hi> of Chriſt, and in the <hi>ſtudy</hi> of his <hi>own heart;</hi> the <hi>ſtudy</hi> of our <hi>own hearts</hi> will make us ſee the need we have of Chriſt and his grace. He that ſtudys his own heart, will ſee his conſtant need of Chriſt and divine grace; the more we ſtudy our own hearts
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:64024:187"/>and are acquainted with them, the more clearly ſhall we ſee the natural <hi>propenſion</hi> that is in us unto evil, we ſhall alſo ſee our <hi>impotency</hi> and <hi>inability</hi> to what is good, yea not only our <hi>impotency</hi> and <hi>inability</hi> to what is good, but our averſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and indiſpoſition to what is good, alſo our <hi>inſtability</hi> and <hi>inconſtancy</hi> in what is good, and alſo a <hi>proneneſs</hi> and <hi>readineſs</hi> in us to comply with temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon all occaſions. All this will ſhew us the need of divine grace. The more we are acquainted with our own hearts, the more ſhall we ſee how hard and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult a thing it is to get them into a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual frame, and when we have got them into that frame, to keep them in a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al frame. So unſuitable are our hearts to ſpiritual things, that it is hard to get them into a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>heavenly</hi> frame, and when they are ſet a little right to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, they are <hi>unſtable</hi> as water, and ſoon fly off again: theſe things plainly ſhew us the need of divine grace. Let us <hi>examine</hi> our own hearts, and ſee whether they cannot ſet their ſeal to the truth of theſe things, and if ſo, them may we ſee our conſtant need of divine grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We ought to conſider our frequent <hi>retuns</hi> and <hi>relapſes</hi> into the ſame ſins;
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:64024:188"/>yea into the ſame fins after repentance for them; for though a regenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon doth not ordinarily relapſe into the ſame groſs ſins often, <hi>He that is born of God doth not commit ſin,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.10. that is, a regenerate perſon doth not <hi>ordinarily</hi> and <hi>familiarly</hi> fall into groſs ſins, he may be <hi>ſurprized</hi> and <hi>overtaken</hi> with a groſs ſin, ſo <hi>David</hi> and other Saints have been, but a regenerate ſon doth not often relapſe into the ſame <hi>groſs ſin;</hi> but a regenerate perſon may relapſe into ſins of infirmity and ſuch as we have reaſon to account great infirmities. How often do fits of Pride, of Paſſion, of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, of Murmuring, of Impatience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn upon us, yea after we have been humbled for theſe things, and after theſe things have coſt us dear? this ſhews us the great corruption of our nature, and the conſtant need we have of the grace of God; for if we be ſo prone to fall, and ſo ready to be intangled and overcome with Temptation upon every occaſion, though we have mourned over, and prayed againſt the ſin we have been overtaken with, this ſhews us our conſtant need of divine grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To help us to ſee the need of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace, let us Conſider, That the
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:64024:188"/>leaſt <hi>ſuſpenſion</hi> of <hi>divine grace</hi> makes a preſent <hi>decay</hi> or <hi>withering</hi> in our ſouls. Let the Sun withdraw and abſent it ſelf, <hi>darkneſs</hi> and <hi>cold</hi> preſently ſucceeds: cut off the beam from the Sun, the beam cannot maintain it ſelf, the beam is maintained by a conſtant influx and ſupply of light from the Sun the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of light: ſo is it in this caſe, If divine grace withdraw it ſelf, our ſouls grow dark and dead immediately. Let the influences of divine grace be but ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, that activity and vigour of grace that was in our ſouls before, doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently vaniſh, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.4. <hi>As the branch cannot bring forth fruit unleſs it abide in the Vine, no more can ye, unleſs ye abide in me.</hi> In the ſame moment that the branch is ſevered from the ſtock, it begins to wither and die immediately: No ſooner do we ſever our ſelves (as it were) from Chriſt, by <hi>neglecting</hi> our <hi>dependance</hi> on Chriſt, but we loſe our grecnneſs and freſhneſs immediately. It is true, the <hi>radical</hi> union, if I may ſo call it, which is between Chriſt and a ſoul, that alwaies remains, for once <hi>in Chriſt</hi> and ever <hi>in</hi> Chriſt, the <hi>radical</hi> and <hi>fundamental</hi> union that is between Chriſt and a true Believer is indiſſoluble;
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:64024:189"/>but if we do not maintain and keep up the life and ſpirit of this union (if I may ſo expreſs it) by actual dependance on Chriſt, preſent <hi>decays</hi> and <hi>witherings</hi> will certainly enſue. Obſerve it in your ſelves, and you will find it true, when you neglect to have recourſe to Chriſt, and have not that intimate dependance upon him for grace, you ſhall find that your fouls are not ſolively and vigorous in the waies of God, as when you depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon him is kept up high and ſtrong. The leaſt ſuſpenſion of actual grace from Chriſt laies us under preſent witherings and decaies.</p>

               <p>THat which we were laſt treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, was to ſhew what <hi>Means</hi> we ought to uſe, that we may keep up the conſtant ſenſe of the need of Divine grace.</p>
               <p>Two or three have been already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We ſhould be much verſed in the ſtudy of our own hearts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we would keep up the ſenſe of our need of divine grace, we ought to conſider our frequent returns and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſes into the ſame ſins, even after repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider that the leaſt ſuſpenſion of divine grace, makes a preſent decay and withering in our ſpirits. We now proceed to a fourth <hi>Means</hi> or <hi>Help.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. To make us ſenſible of the need of divine grace, Conſider, We cannot <hi>live</hi> upon <hi>grace already received;</hi> all our
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:64024:190"/>former <hi>attainments</hi> in grace are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to carry us out to act ſpiritually, without new ſupplies of grace, 1 <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.9. <hi>This ſhall turn to my ſalvation through your prayer, and the ſupply of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> word properly ſignifies an <hi>additional ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> There muſt be an <hi>additional ſupply</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> to all the former grace which we have received, to make us to act ſpiritually. It is not enough that we have <hi>habitual grace,</hi> but we muſt have <hi>actual</hi> grace to <hi>excite</hi> and draw forth the habits of grace to <hi>act</hi> in us, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Awake, O North wind, and come thou South, blow upon my gar den, that the ſpices thereof may flow forth.</hi> Though we have habits of grace in us, which are here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to <hi>Spices,</hi> yet we muſt have <hi>actual</hi> grace, <hi>freſh gales</hi> and influences of the Spirit to draw forth the habits of grace into exerciſe, otherwiſe our <hi>Graces</hi> will be like unbeaten Spices which ſend forth no ſavour. And it is not enough that we have actual grace at one time, but we muſt have freſh <hi>gales</hi> of the Spirit upon all occaſions to carry us forth with <hi>new vigour</hi> in the waies of God. A Ship that hath a fair <hi>gale</hi> of wind, for the preſent, to fill its Sails, makes way
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:64024:190"/>amain, but it can run its courſe no longer than that guſt of wind laſts; when the guſt is gone, the Ship ſoon flags and ſlackens in its courſe: Thus it is with us, when we are under freſh gales of the Spirit, we can make ſome ſpeed and good progreſs in the ways of God, but when the gale &amp; guſt is gone we are ſoon becalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we many times truſt in our own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, we truſt in our own inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in duty, and becauſe we have found ſuch affections at one time, we think we can command the ſame affections again; and becauſe we have found ſuch and ſuch inlargements in duty, we think we can do ſo ſtill. But we ought to know and conſider, that all theſe affections and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements are but the <hi>effects</hi> of <hi>divine grace.</hi> It is the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens our affections and inlargeth our hearts. Now if we truſt in the effect, and not in the cauſe, we ſhall ſoon find our ſelves greatly deceived. When <hi>Sampſons</hi> locks were <hi>ſhorn,</hi> he thought to <hi>go out</hi> and <hi>ſhake himſelf,</hi> as at other times, but he wiſt not that <hi>the Spirit of the Lord was departed from him,</hi> Judg. 16.20. Thus it is with us, becauſe we have ſuch quickenings and inlargements at one time, we think we can go forth in
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:64024:191"/>the ſtrength of theſe things, and do as formerly we have done; but we do not conſider that unleſs we have the ſame preſence of divine grace to act us now as acted us heretofore, we cannot act as then we did.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To make us ſenſible of the need of divine grace, let us conſider, We cannot live upon our <hi>former comforts,</hi> and the former experiences we have had of Gods love. Although we have had ſome aſſurance of Gods love, although we have had ſome experience of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al comforts, although there hath been ſuch things paſſed between God and our ſouls, as that we would think we ſhould never loſe the comfort of them: yet without freſh incomes of divine grace, we cannot bear up in a time of extremity. I would not be miſtaken here, I know a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> lawfully may and ought to make uſe of all the experiences he hath had of Gods love, but if he truſt in theſe, and if he think he need not <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent actual grace</hi> to help and ſupport him in a time of extremity, all his experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences may fail him: and the reaſon is plain, becauſe God may ſuffer a <hi>veil</hi> to be drawn over all a mans former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and experiences, that he ſhall have
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:64024:191"/>little uſe of them for the preſent. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf (which is the higheſt inſtance that can be given) had a veil drawn over all his comforts; he had been inured to the ſight of God all his life, he had walkt in the light of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers countenance all his daies, yet all of a ſudden, he cries out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me.</hi> It is true he was never deſerted in point of grace, he had the preſence of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to act him alwaies in a way of <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> yet there was a veil drawn over all his <hi>comforts,</hi> there was a ſuſpenſion of comfort and manifeſtation. Therefore ſince it is poſſible that there may be a veil drawn over all our comforts, it is good for us to pray for a conſtant ſupply of <hi>divine influences</hi> to ſupport and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us.</p>
               <p>I remember a paſſage of an holy man, and one of great experience in the waies of God, <hi>I find it beſt,</hi> faith he, <hi>when I come to greateſt heights of peace and aſſurance, to mind what is my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent duty, otherwiſe I meet with a cloud.</hi> Truely if we truſt in our own at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments in grace, and upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and experience we have had already of Gods love, and do not maintain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:64024:192"/>dependance upon him for new ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of grace, we may ſoon meet with a cloud, for God loves to keep us in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To ſhew us the conſtant need that we have of divine grace, let us take in this great Conſideration, Nothing but <hi>preſent actual grace</hi> can carry us through our greateſt extremities. When it comes to a time of great affliction, when we are caſt into great ſtreights and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, when we are brought to a <hi>dying hour,</hi> nothing but preſent actual grace can carry us through theſe things: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though former experiences, although grace received may be of ſome uſe to us, yet over and above all theſe things we muſt have preſent actual grace to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry us through a time of great extremity. I do many times think with my ſelf what may be of greateſt uſe to a man to carry him through a <hi>dying hour,</hi> how a man may be beſt prepared for a dying hour; and truly there may be ſeveral things that may be of uſe to a Chriſtian this way, I ſhall hint at a few briefly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One thing may be, The <hi>renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of a mans former <hi>evidences,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the more <hi>eminent actings</hi> of grace that have been in his ſoul.
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:64024:192"/>There is no <hi>Chriſtian</hi> that hath walkt with God for any conſiderable time, but upon reflection, he may remember ſome more eminent and remarkable actings of Gods grace in him, concerning which he may ſay, This, if any thing, was the grace of God in me: this may be of ſome uſe to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another thing may be the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of what hath paſſed between God and a man in his whole life. Many of the Saints can ſay, at ſuch and ſuch times there were ſuch paſſages between God and their ſouls which they have reaſon never to forget; when they taſted and felt ſuch things, they thought thoſe were evidences of the love of God to them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third thing which I look upon to be of great moment is this, The ſetting of ſome ſpecial promiſes before the eye of a mans ſoul, upon which he may be able to venture his ſoul: God hath ſaid, <hi>He that believes on his Son ſhall not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 3.18. Joh. 6.40.</note> again, <hi>He that believes on his Son ſhall have eternal life.</hi> Now to lay ſome clear certain great and fundamental promiſes before the eye of a mans ſoul, and to venture his Soul upon the bottom of theſe promiſes, is one main way to help a man in a dying hour. It is ſaid of
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:64024:193"/>the <hi>ancient</hi> Saints, <hi>They all dyed in Faith, not having received the Promiſe,</hi> Heb. 11.13. They all dyed in Faith, that is, they took Gods Word for their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; we muſt all venture our Salvation upon the bottom of Gods Word, we muſt be able to ſingle out ſome Word of God, and ſay, Upon the bottom of this Word I can venture my ſoul, venture my eternal eſtate: Theſe are of good uſe to us in a dying hour.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But that which I take to be the <hi>principal means,</hi> above all other, is this, To pray for preſent actual grace, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry us through a dying hour. Though the remembrance of former experiences, the remembring what God hath beſtowed upon us, the ſetting the Promiſes before the eye of our ſouls may be of great uſe to us, yet that which is neceſſary, over and above all this, is actual grace in a dying hour: For neither the grace we have received, nor former experiences, nor the promiſes will be of uſe to us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we have actual grace to help us to make uſe of them. Therefore I conceive that here doth the main skill of a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> lie, if we would be carryed through a <hi>dying hour,</hi> we ſhould pray much that God would not deſert us in point of
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:64024:193"/>grace, that he would not deſert us in that hour, but <hi>own</hi> us, <hi>ſtand by</hi> us, and <hi>aſſiſt</hi> us in that hour; <hi>Though I walk,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, through the valley of the ſhadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me,</hi> Pſal. 23.4. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our great prayer ſhould be, that we may have actual grace to uphold us in the <hi>difficulties</hi> of life, and to carry us through the <hi>agonies</hi> of death: The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is, <hi>I will never leave thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 13.5.</note> 
                  <hi>nor for ſake thee.</hi> Now we ought to put this, and ſuch like <hi>promiſes</hi> in ſuit, that ſo we may never be deſerted in point of grace; and if we have the conſtant preſence of divine grace with us, that will carry us through death it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And thus I have diſpatched that firſt <hi>Doctrine,</hi> viz. <hi>Holy ſouls are ſenſible of the need which they have of divine grace.</hi> The</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. Second Doctrine is this, <hi>The ſenſe of the need which we have of divine grace, ſhould make us pray much for the drawings of divine grace: Draw me,</hi> and <hi>we will run after thee.</hi> Her praying for <hi>drawing,</hi> ſuppoſeth her want and need of drawing, and her <hi>praying</hi> for theſe drawings of divine
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:64024:194"/>grace ſpeaks the greatneſs and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her deſires after them.</p>
               <p>Here we have two things to ſpeak to;
<list>
                     <item>1. To ſhew what theſe <hi>drawings</hi> of divine grace are. And</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>How,</hi> and by <hi>what means</hi> it is that God is wont to draw the ſouls of his people to himſelf.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. What theſe drawings of divine grace are, I ſhall ſpeak to this,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In <hi>General;</hi> and then ſhew you how it is that God draws the ſouls of his people to himſelf, or by what means it is he doth this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What theſe drawings of divine grace are. Theſe drawings of divine grace, I take to be the <hi>quickenings</hi> or <hi>excitations</hi> of the Spirit of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſoul is elevated and raiſed above its natural pitch, and carryed forth with life and vigour in the waies of God. God is ſaid to <hi>draw</hi> thoſe,<note place="margin">Quot efficaciter movet &amp; impel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit ad aliquid agendu.</note> 
                  <hi>whom he doth efficaciouſly move or ſtir up to do any thing.</hi> When God doth ſtir up, and effectually move a perſon to do a thing, then he is ſaid to <hi>draw</hi> him; hence it is ſaid in <hi>Judg.</hi> 7.4. <hi>I will draw unto thee Siſera the Captain of Jabins Army,</hi> that is, I will <hi>move</hi> him, and <hi>incline</hi> him to come out againſt thee. Now theſe
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:64024:194"/>
                  <hi>drawings</hi> of divine grace do ſuppoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They ſuppoſe ſome <hi>diſtance</hi> and <hi>eſtrangement</hi> that there is between God and us; if there were not ſome diſtance and eſtrangement between God and us, we ſhould not need divine grace to draw us near to him: therefore when the <hi>Church</hi> prays here to be <hi>drawn,</hi> it is to be ſuppoſed that ſhe found ſome <hi>diſtance</hi> and eſtrangement that was between God and her.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe <hi>drawings</hi> ſuppoſe ſome <hi>dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, indiſpoſition,</hi> and <hi>unaptneſs</hi> in our ſelves to <hi>move</hi> towards God. If we were not <hi>dead</hi> and backward to come to God, what need we divine grace to draw us to him?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe drawings ſuppoſe our <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>inability</hi> to move towards God. <hi>No man can come to me,</hi> ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>except the Father which hath ſent me draw him,</hi> Joh. 6.44. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we need <hi>divine grace</hi> to <hi>inable</hi> us to <hi>come,</hi> it is a ſign that we cannot <hi>come</hi> of our ſelves: theſe <hi>drawings</hi> are a ſign of our <hi>infirmity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. They ſuppoſe an <hi>act</hi> of Gods <hi>power,</hi> and the exerting of <hi>efficacious grace</hi> to inable us to move towards God.
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:64024:195"/>
                  <hi>Drawing</hi> is an act of <hi>power,</hi> Job 24.22. <hi>He draweth alſo the mighty with his power,</hi> Pſal. 110.4. <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power.</hi> It is an <hi>act</hi> of <hi>power</hi> to make us <hi>willing,</hi> who are naturally <hi>unwilling.</hi> God of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing,</hi> makes us <hi>willing.</hi> It is God that <hi>works</hi> in us to <hi>will, Phil.</hi> 2.13. It is God that efficaciouſly works in us the very <hi>act</hi> of willing:<note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> the <hi>act</hi> of <hi>willing ſpiritually</hi> proceeds from the <hi>energy</hi> or <hi>effectual working of Gods power.</hi> It is true we have a <hi>natural faculty</hi> to <hi>will;</hi> but to <hi>will ſpiritually,</hi> this is the effect of Gods power and grace in us, and it is God that works in us <hi>ſo</hi> to <hi>will.</hi> Thus have I ſhewn the nature of theſe draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in General. But the</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thing is that which is of greateſt moment, <hi>How</hi> is it that God draws the ſouls of his people to himſelf; by what <hi>means</hi> is it that God thus draws us?</p>
               <p>God draws the ſouls of his people to himſelf ſeveral waies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By ſetting his <hi>excellencys</hi> before the eye of the Soul, <hi>Draw me,</hi> ſaith the Church here, how is that? How would ſhe be <hi>drawn? Draw me</hi> by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thine excellencys before me, by preſenting thine amiableneſs unto me,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:64024:195"/>this ſeems clearly intended by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in this <hi>Verſe, The King hath brought me into his Chambers:</hi> the <hi>Chambers</hi> are the place where the <hi>King</hi> manifeſts his <hi>preſence,</hi> there he is to be <hi>ſeen,</hi> the Church therefore prays to be drawn by being admitted to a ſight and view of Chriſt, by having a proſpect of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencys given to her. This is certain, nothing is ſo attractive to the ſoul as the ſight of Gods excellency. If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult our own experience we ſhall find it true, one great cauſe of all our damps and deadneſſes is, that we have loſt the ſight of God that ſometimes we have had, we have not that <hi>ſight</hi> and <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the divine excellency that ſometimes we have had. Our <hi>affections</hi> cannot riſe higher than our <hi>apprehenſions;</hi> if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have loſt thoſe <hi>clear</hi> and lively <hi>apprehenſions</hi> we have had of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it is no wonder we have loſt our affections towards him. When we have clear apprehenſions of God and Chriſt, then we ſee a <hi>ſurpaſſing glory</hi> in <hi>that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> above all others. One <hi>true ſight</hi> of God makes all other things ſeem <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> Iſa. 33.17. <hi>Thine eyes ſhall ſee the King in his beauty, thou ſhalt behold the Land which is very far off.</hi> When
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:64024:196"/>once the ſoul hath a ſight of God in his <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> all the creatures ſeem to be at a great <hi>remove</hi> and <hi>diſtance.</hi> The <hi>creatures</hi> ſeem to be but <hi>little</hi> when once the <hi>Creator</hi> himſelf appears. This therefore is one way by which God <hi>draws</hi> us, by <hi>preſenting</hi> himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eye of the ſoul. It is a great Text, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21. <hi>If any man love me, I will manifeſt my ſelf to him.</hi> The Word here uſed is a <hi>precious</hi> word, it hath much of heavenly ſweetneſs in it to an holy ſoul that values Chriſts <hi>preſence,</hi>

I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to explain this word as fully as may be, becauſe it is ſo <hi>precious</hi> a <hi>word, I will manifeſt my ſelf to him.</hi> Thus we read how <hi>Joſeph made himſelf known to his Brethren:</hi> Thus Chriſt makes himſelf <hi>known</hi> to his people, by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little of his glory to them, and lets them know what he is; and <hi>one beam</hi> of the <hi>divine Majeſty</hi> let in upon the ſoul, will ſoon attract and draw the ſoul to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt <hi>attracts</hi> and <hi>draws</hi> ſouls to himſelf by the <hi>merit</hi> of his <hi>ſufferings,</hi> Joh. 12.32. <hi>And I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men after me,</hi> that is, I, when I am lifted up upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> by the <hi>merit</hi> of my death and ſuffering will draw all men after me. It is a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Scripture, and hath ſomething of a <hi>myſterious</hi> ſignification in it, <hi>Matth.</hi>
                  <pb n="382" facs="tcp:64024:197"/>24.28. <hi>Where the Carkaſs is, thither the Eagles will be gathered together.</hi> The Eagle is famous for her <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>piercing eye;</hi> the Eagle by her <hi>pierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> eye can ſee the Carkaſs at a great diſtance. An <hi>Eagle-eyed Chriſtian</hi> can ſee that <hi>worth</hi> and <hi>excellency</hi> in a <hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Chriſt</hi> which another cannot ſee, <hi>My fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed,</hi> Joh. 6.55. An Eagle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyed Chriſtian can diſcern that the fleſh of Chriſt is the food and nouriſhment of ſouls. An Eagle-eyed Chriſtian can perceive that it was in that <hi>fleſh</hi> of his, that the Law was fulfilled, that the penalty of it was undergone, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine juſtice was fatisfied, and everlaſting righteouſneſs brought in, this attracts a believing ſoul to a <hi>Crucified Chriſt; Chriſt Crucified is to ſome a ſtumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>block,</hi> and to others <hi>fooliſhneſs,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. but to thoſe that underſtand the myſterie of his death and ſuffierings, Chriſt is the <hi>wiſdom of God, and the power of God.</hi> Hence is that of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.2.</note> 
                  <hi>I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to know nothing ſave Jeſus Chriſt and him Crucified;</hi> ſo likewife <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>I count all things but loſs, for the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt my Lord, for whom I have ſuffered the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:64024:197"/>loſs of all things, and do count them but dung that I may win Chriſt.</hi> Nothing will attract the heart more than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fideration of what Chriſt is, and the contemplation of what Chriſt hath done and ſuffered for us, the <hi>name</hi> of Chriſt is as <hi>oyntment poured forth, therefore do the Virgins love him,</hi> Cant. 1.4. The more we know Chriſt in his perſonal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and are acquainted with his grace as <hi>Mediator,</hi> the more will our hearts be attracted and drawn to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt draws us by the <hi>diſcovery</hi> of his <hi>love</hi> to us, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.4. <hi>I drew them with the cords of a man, with bands of love:</hi> Love is the <hi>loadſtone</hi> of Love; we Love him <hi>becauſe he firſt loved us,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.19. Nothing ſo powerſul to draw our hearts to the love of God as the <hi>apprehenſion</hi> of Gods Love to us. Now God doth ſometimes drop and diſtill the ſenſe of his love into the hearts of his people, and that draws them to Love him. Obſerve it in your ſelves, when the heart hath been very low, flat, and dead before, let the Lord but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finuate a little of his Love to the Soul, by ſome eſpecial act of <hi>kindneſs,</hi> that will <hi>raiſe</hi> and <hi>quicken</hi> it immediately. Love is powerful and <hi>attractive,</hi> it
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:64024:198"/>melts and diſſolves the ſoul: if the ſoul be but in an ill <hi>frame</hi> before, let the Lord but manifeſt a little of his Love, and it is ſoon overcome by it, and put into a better frame.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God draw the ſouls of his people to himſelf by giving them <hi>new</hi> and <hi>freſh taſtes</hi> of the <hi>excellencie</hi> of <hi>ſpiritual things.</hi> The Saints themſelves do not alwaies reliſh that ſavour that is in the Word, nor taſte that ſweetneſs that is in the Promiſes; I ſay, they do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies taſte <hi>a like</hi> ſweetneſs in the Word, nor reliſh <hi>a like ſavour</hi> in it, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they have done; and when they have loſt that <hi>taſte</hi> and <hi>reliſh</hi> that they had of ſpiritual things, this is that which makes their affections flat. If we had as <hi>lively taſtes</hi> of ſpiritual things, as we have ſometimes, our affections would not ſo often flag as they do, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. <hi>As new born Babes deſire the ſincere milk of the word. If ſo be ye have taſted that the Lord is gracious.</hi> Thoſe that have once taſted of the <hi>ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> of the <hi>word,</hi> cannot but ſtill deſire it as long as that taſte remains with them. Conſider, O Chriſtian, what glory doth there appear in the Word at ſome times? What excellency
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:64024:198"/>and heavenly ſweetneſs in the promiſes at one time over and above what there doth at another? Now God allures and draws the hearts of his people, by giving in thoſe taſtes and reliſhes of ſpiritual things at ſome times, which they are not ſenſible of at other times. <hi>No man,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>having drunk old Wine, ſtraightway deſireth new, for he ſaith the old is better,</hi> Luk. 5.39. So when the ſoul hath newly taſted of the ſweetneſs that is in God and Chriſt, when it hath taſted of the ſweetneſs that is in the Promiſes, and in divine grace and heavenly conſolations, it doth not preſently grow fond of the <hi>world</hi> and <hi>worldly comforts:</hi> the ſweetneſs the ſoul hath taſted and experienced in heavenly and ſpiritual things, attracts the ſoul to Love and defire theſe things above all others. And we ſhall find it true in experience, That when we grow fond of other things, it is becauſe we have loſt thoſe taſtes of God and Chriſt and ſpiritual things, which ſometimes we have had.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And laſtly, The laſt thing I ſhall mention at preſent, is this, God at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts and draws the hearts of his people by giving them a little <hi>ſight</hi> and <hi>proſpect</hi>
                  <pb n="386" facs="tcp:64024:199"/>of that <hi>glory which</hi> is above, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have entred into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him;</hi> but ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit,</hi> that is, God hath revealed them to us in <hi>part</hi> by his Spirit. It is not poſſible that we ſhould take in the Glory that is above, in our minds and conceptions, as it is in it ſelf, but God gives ſome little <hi>prelibations</hi> and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtes of it unto his people. Hence is it that we read of <hi>the taſting of the good Word of God,</hi> and <hi>taſting of the power of the world to come,</hi> Heb. 6.4, 5. It is poſſible that a man that is under a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon work</hi> of the Spirit (for it is of ſuch the Apoſtle there ſpeaks) may have ſome <hi>taſtes</hi> of the <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of heaven. I do not think that thoſe that are meerly under a common work, and are ſaid here to <hi>taſte of the heavenly gifts,</hi> and of the <hi>powers of the world</hi> to come, that they have, or can have ſuch <hi>taſtes</hi> of the <hi>ſweetneſs, glory,</hi> and <hi>bleſſedneſs</hi> of heaven, as thoſe have who are truly regencrate, and are under a <hi>ſaving work;</hi> but ſome apprehenſions they may have of it, they may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:64024:199"/>it to be a ſtate of <hi>bliſs</hi> and <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> A man that is under the common work of the Spirit may apprehend Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to be a place of freedom from all <hi>miſery</hi> and trouble, and where he ſhall enjoy happineſs and perfect bliſs, and have all joy, peace, comfort, and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: ſuch like <hi>general apprehenſions</hi> of Heaven is all, I conceive, that a man under a <hi>common work</hi> doth uſually attain unto. Now if a man that hath but a common work may go ſo far, then the Saints who have more than a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon work, they that have divine and <hi>ſaving illumination,</hi> may apprehend much more of the glory of Heaven. The Saints who are <hi>ſavingly enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> may apprehend ſomething of <hi>this ſtate,</hi> as it conſiſts in the <hi>clear ſight</hi> and <hi>viſion</hi> of God, in <hi>intimate fellowſhip</hi> and <hi>communion</hi> with God, in <hi>perfect holineſs,</hi> and the like. Nothing doth more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attract the ſoul than when ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the glory of the other world is ſet before it. Now God doth ſometimes let down a corner of <hi>Heaven,</hi> as it were, into the ſouls of his people, and gives them in <hi>tranſitu,</hi> a little glimpſe and glance of the glory that is above, and this makes all <hi>preſent things</hi> ſeem to be
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:64024:200"/>but little things to them. <hi>We look not,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>to the things which are ſeen, for they are temporal, but we look unto the things which are not ſeen, for they are eternal,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.18. When a man, by the eye of Faith, hath a little proſpect of the <hi>Heavenly Country,</hi> and and when he beholds the <hi>perfect ſereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> the <hi>tranquillity,</hi> the <hi>unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> the <hi>bleſſedneſs,</hi> the <hi>joy,</hi> the <hi>ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi> the <hi>delights</hi> that are in that Country, this muſt needs attract and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure the ſoul to the deſire and love of theſe things, becauſe theſe things do far excel any thing that is to be found in this world. Who would not prefer an <hi>unchangeable ſtate</hi> before a <hi>changeable?</hi> perfect ſerenity and tranquillity, before conſtant trouble? perfect joy and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, before a ſtate of grief and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row? Therefore when the ſoul hath a little proſpect, by Faith, of that bleſſed life and ſtate that is above; this muſt needs attract the deſires of the ſoul, to deſire the happineſs and bleſſedneſs of this ſtate, infinitely above all other things, <hi>In his preſence is fulneſs of joy, at his right hand there are pleaſures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> Pſal. 16.11. This is certain, the clearer apprehenſions we have of the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi>
                  <pb n="389" facs="tcp:64024:200"/>of the <hi>divine preſence,</hi> the more ſhall we thirſt and long after it; this is evident from the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.8, <hi>We are confident and willing rather to be abſent from the body, and preſent with the Lord;</hi> we <hi>delight</hi> moſt to be preſent with the Lord:<note place="margin">

               <p>THere are, as we have heard, ſeveral waies and means by which God is wont to draw the hearts of his people to himſelf, I have mentioned five already.</p>
               <p>There is one thing more, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is one of the principal means by which God draws the hearts of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to himſelf; I ſhall ſpeak to that, and then come to the Uſe and Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Point.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſixth means therefore is this, God draws his people by the <hi>ſecret touches</hi> of his Spirit, and by the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi> of <hi>divine power</hi> upon their hearts, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.4. <hi>My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him. My be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved put in his hand by the hole of the door,</hi> that is, he gave me a <hi>ſecret touch</hi>
                  <pb n="391" facs="tcp:64024:201"/>by the <hi>finger</hi> of his <hi>Spirit.</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> of God is ſometimes called the finger of God, and that plainly appears if we compare two Scriptures together, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.20. with <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.28. in one place, it is ſaid, <hi>If I by the finger of God caſt out Devils:</hi> In the other place it is ſaid, <hi>If I caſt out Devils by the Spirit of God.</hi> The Spirit of God then is called the finger of God. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the <hi>hand of God</hi> denotes the power of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.11. <hi>Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious in power.</hi> And this expreſſion, <hi>the hand of God,</hi> is ſometimes uſed to ſet forth the cauſe of mens converſion, together with the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of it, the <hi>ſaving work</hi> of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God upon the hearts of men, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.21. <hi>And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned unto the Lord.</hi> So that this is the plain meaning, <hi>Chriſt put forth his hand by the hole of the door,</hi> that is, he gave the Church a <hi>ſecret touch</hi> by the <hi>finger</hi> of his Spirit. What followed upon this, what was the effect of this? that which followed was this, <hi>My bowels were moved for him,</hi> the Churches affections were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently <hi>quickened</hi> and <hi>raiſed</hi> by this <hi>touch,</hi>
                  <pb n="392" facs="tcp:64024:202"/>though ſhe was dead, liſtleſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed before, one touch of the Spirit quickened and raiſed her affections, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes.</hi> The Lord had promiſed to give a <hi>new heart,</hi> and a <hi>new ſpirit</hi> before this; in the <hi>Verſe</hi> before it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Verſe 26.</note> 
                  <hi>A new heart will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you;</hi> and yet over and above this, the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, <hi>I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes.</hi> When God promiſeth to give a new Heart, and a new Spirit, that which is intended by it, is the <hi>work of the Spirit</hi> upon the heart, framing the New creature in us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Unleſs a man be born of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God;</hi> and yet although there be a <hi>new heart,</hi> and a <hi>new ſpirit</hi> given to us, and formed in us, by the Spirit of God; yet over and above this God muſt <hi>put his Spirit into us, and cauſe us to walk in his Statutes;</hi> and this plainly ſhews, that the <hi>habits</hi> of Grace are not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of themſelves, without <hi>actual grace,</hi> to carry us forth to any act of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for what need is there that God
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:64024:202"/>ſhould promiſe to <hi>put his Spirit into us, and cauſe us to walk in his Statutes,</hi> after he had before promiſed the <hi>new heart</hi> and <hi>new ſpirit,</hi> if the habits of grace of themſelves had been ſufficient to carry us out to all ſpiritual actions? But now the Lord promiſeth to <hi>put his Spirit within us, and cauſe us to walk in his Statutes, and that we ſhall keep his Judgements and doe them,</hi> and what doth he intend by all this? Certainly thus much, that he will not only give us the <hi>habits</hi> of grace, but he will put his Spirit into us, as a <hi>conſtant Spring</hi> to ſeed and maintain his own grace in us, and that he will <hi>act</hi> us by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: He will give us that <hi>actual grace</hi> by his Spirit, that ſhall help us to make uſe of thoſe habits of grace that he hath planted in us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. <hi>As many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the Children of God.</hi> The Children of God then are <hi>led</hi> by the Spirit of God, the Spirit of God is no <hi>ſtranger</hi> in the hearts of the Children of God. No, as many as are the Children of God, are <hi>guided,</hi> led and acted by the Spirit of God. Hence is it that we read of <hi>the power that worketh in us,</hi> Epheſ. 3.20. <hi>according to the power that worketh in us.</hi>
                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:64024:203"/>There is a power that is continually <hi>working</hi> in the heart of the Saints, and by this power it is, that they are drawn to God. God draws the hearts of his people by the <hi>viſits</hi> of his Spirit, and by the <hi>freſh gales</hi> of divine grace. Look as a <hi>Ship</hi> that is under a <hi>freſh gale</hi> can <hi>ſpeed</hi> her courſe amain: ſo when the Saints are under <hi>new and freſh gales</hi> of the Spirit, then they find their hearts drawn out towards God, and carryed forth in the waies of God, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 119.132. <hi>I will run the way of thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when thou ſhalt inlarge my heart.</hi> God muſt firſt <hi>inlarge</hi> our hearts before we can <hi>run</hi> the <hi>way</hi> of his <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> When the Spirit of God <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges</hi> the heart, and <hi>fills</hi> the <hi>ſails,</hi> then the ſoul can <hi>run</hi> and <hi>move ſwiftly</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. Thus have I ſhewn the ſeveral waies by which God is wont to draw the hearts of his people to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>I come now to the Application of the Doctrine. And</p>
               <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">Uſe <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> The firſt uſe ſhall be by way of <hi>information.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us learn that it is poſſible for the <hi>Saints</hi> themſelves to fall under <hi>ſpiritual dullneſs</hi> and deadneſs. The Church we
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:64024:203"/>ſee here in the <hi>Text,</hi> finds her ſelf in ſuch a frame, as that ſhe needs divine grace to draw and quicken her. Now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſhe had ſome ſenſe of <hi>ſpiritual dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>deadneſs</hi> that was come upon her, there had been no ſuch neceſſity for her to pray for theſe drawings: But this is an Argument that the Church found her heart more indiſpoſed to the waies of God than heretofore, and that is the reaſon ſhe prays that ſhe might be drawn. Sad experience ſhews it to be true, that after we have felt the moſt <hi>lively</hi> and <hi>effectual</hi> workings of the Spirit of God in our hearts, after we have had the greateſt <hi>taſtes</hi> of <hi>ſpiritual joys</hi> and <hi>comforts,</hi> after our hearts have been moſt <hi>inlarged</hi> in <hi>holy affections</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, yet oftentimes we fall into <hi>ſpiritual deadneſs</hi> and <hi>dullneſs;</hi> we do not feel that <hi>life</hi> and <hi>power</hi> in our ſouls as heretofore, there is a greater indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſedneſs and liſtleſneſs in us <hi>to</hi> holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; we are not ſo <hi>lively in</hi> holy duties, our affections are not ſo <hi>ſtirring</hi> and <hi>working</hi> towards God, we have not that <hi>reliſh</hi> in the promiſes, we do not ſo <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce</hi> in them, we are not ſo <hi>active</hi> for God, we are not ſo fruitful in our places, we have not that hatred of ſin, neither
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:64024:204"/>do we make that reſiſtance againſt it, as ſometimes we have done. All theſe things and more that might be inſtanced in, do ſhew, that oftentimes the beſt of Gods Children do fall under <hi>dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of heart, and ſpiritual dullneſs. Now the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of this ſpiritual dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and deadneſs are commonly ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Unthankfulneſs</hi> for grace received. <hi>Unthankfulneſs</hi> is a <hi>greater ſin,</hi> and coſts us dearer than we are aware of; God takes nothing more unkindly at the hands of his people, than their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſs for his own grace beſtowed upon them. When we are not ſenſible how much God hathdone for us in giving us his grace, this doth many times pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to take away his grace from us, and then we ſoon fall under this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual deadneſs and dullneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond Cauſe of <hi>dullneſs</hi> and <hi>deadneſs</hi> in the Saints is this, <hi>Neglect</hi> of <hi>ſome</hi> of the <hi>means</hi> of grace, either in <hi>publick</hi> or <hi>private.</hi> If we neglect any one of the means of grace, we ſhall ſoon find dullneſs and deadneſs come upon us; for this is certain, the infinite wiſe God hath appointed no one means of grace in vain. And ſo naturally dull
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:64024:204"/>and dead are our hearts, that there is not one of the means of grace but we need it Therefore if we neglect any of the means; if we attend <hi>publick ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> and in the mean time are negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in private Prayer, reading the Word, meditating of it, and <hi>ſelf-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination,</hi> this may be one cauſe of <hi>deadneſs.</hi> On the other hand, if we uſe private means, as <hi>Prayer, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> and the like, if we neglect <hi>publick</hi> means, or any of the Ordinances which God hath appointed; if we come to hear the Word, but neglect the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, or any one inſtituted means which God hath appointed for our help, that may bring this deadneſs on us. For it is certain, we need all the means of grace, and the more we come to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand our own hearts, the more we are concerned about our <hi>ſpiritual ſtate,</hi> the more we ſhall <hi>ſee</hi> our need of all the means which God hath appointed for our help and quickening. And if we conſult our own experience, we ſhall find that when we are moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs in the uſe of the <hi>means,</hi> then doth ſpiritual <hi>deadneſs</hi> and dullneſs come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another Cauſe of this <hi>ſpiritual
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:64024:205"/>dullneſs</hi> and <hi>deadneſs</hi> is ſome <hi>ſecret cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions</hi> that we indulge in our ſelves. <hi>Exhort one another,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 3.13.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>leſt any of you be hardened through the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of ſin.</hi> Sin is a <hi>deceitful thing,</hi> and will <hi>harden</hi> the heart; any ſin <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived</hi> at, <hi>beloved</hi> and <hi>entertained</hi> will <hi>harden</hi> the <hi>heart:</hi> When that <hi>Love</hi> that ſhould be let out to God and the waies of God is turned aſide to a luſt, that muſt needs harden the heart. Beſides any ſin <hi>indulged,</hi> grieves the Spirit of God: the Spirit of God is not wont to take occaſion to withdraw becauſe of ſins of infirmity; but if any ſin be indulged and allowed, and get ſome liking and conſent in the will, and be harboured by us, this grieves the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God being grieved ſoon retires, and when the Spirit withdraws and retires, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual dullneſs and deadneſs muſt needs follow.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another great Cauſe of this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritural dullneſs and deadneſs that comes upon the hearts of the Saints, is, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate affections</hi> to earthly things. The ſtrength of the affections cannot go forth two waies at once; therefore if the affections be carried out violently,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:64024:205"/>impetuouſly, and beyond their due bounds towards earthly things, they cannot be carryed out with that vigour towards God and the waies of God as they ought to be. It is the <hi>violence</hi> and <hi>impetuouſneſs</hi> of our affections un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other things, that puts ſuch a damp upon them in reference to God and the things of God: let us look unto our own experience and we ſhall find it to be true.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And laſtly, Another Cauſe of this <hi>dullneſs</hi> and <hi>deadneſs,</hi> is, <hi>reſting</hi> in the grace that we have received, and <hi>preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> on it, becauſe we have had ſuch <hi>quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings,</hi> ſuch inlargements in duty; becauſe we have found ſome affections towards God, we think we can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the ſame quickenings, the ſame inlargements, the ſame affections at our pleaſure. Now when we reſt in what we have already received, and think we have quickening and inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at command, this cauſeth the Spirit to withdraw from us, and then we ſoon fall into ſpiritual deadneſs and dullneſs. Theſe are uſually the cauſes of the ſpiritual deadneſs and dullneſs that comes upon the Saints. Now we
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:64024:206"/>ought not to give way to this ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al deadneſs and dullneſs, but to pray and ſtrive much againſt it. Holy ſouls, the more grace they have, the more ſenſible they are of this ſpiritual deadneſs and dulneſs, when it comes upon them. And the more grace a man hath, he will complain more of theſe inward decaies of his ſoul, and the ſpiritual deadneſs that comes upon him, than he doth of outward afflictions. This was the Churches complaint, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.17. <hi>Why haſt thou made us to erre from thy waies, and hardened our hearts from thy fear?</hi> She complains of the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawings of divine grace, and that ſpiritual <hi>deadneſs</hi> and <hi>hardneſs</hi> that was come upon her. It were happy for us if we could be more ſenſible of the dullneſs and deadneſs that comes upon our affectons, than we are of our outward afflictions; But alas, a little outward affliction touches us to the quick, and makes us to complain very bitterly; but how little ſenſible are we of our deadneſs and dullneſs in the waies of God, and of the loſs of that ſpiritual vigour and livelineſs that formerly we have had? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:64024:206"/>this <hi>deadneſs</hi> and <hi>dullneſs</hi> of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is a <hi>great evil,</hi> a <hi>ſore evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. This deadneſs of ſpirit renders the <hi>graces</hi> which are in us, for the <hi>preſent,</hi> in a great meaſure uſeleſs. It was the ſaying of Mr. <hi>Greenham, Deadneſs of ſpirit is the Grave of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny heavenly graces.</hi> The graces of the Spirit of God are <hi>buried,</hi> as it were, by this dullneſs and deadneſs of heart. When we are under the power of this <hi>dullneſs,</hi> the grace that we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, can neither be beneficial unto others, nor comfortable to our ſelves. The more grace is <hi>viſible</hi> in us, the more benefit do others receive by it, and the more comfort do we our ſelves reap from it. If grace be not <hi>viſible,</hi> as others receive little benefit by us, ſo we our ſelves cannot reap the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of grace in our ſelves. Now whileſt our hearts are dead and dull, there is little <hi>viſibility</hi> of grace in us; ſo that whether we reſpect others <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit</hi> or our own <hi>comfort,</hi> it concerns us to ſtrive againſt this dullneſs and deadneſs of heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As we deprive our ſelves of the comfort of grace, and others of the
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:64024:207"/>benefit of it by this <hi>deadneſs</hi> and <hi>dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> ſo we rob God of his glory, <hi>For hereby</hi> (ſaies our Saviour) <hi>is my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther glorified, that you bring forth much fruit.</hi> The more active and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grace is in us, the more glory hath God from us, and therefore by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, when we are dead and dull, and our graces unactive in us, God hath little honour from us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Spiritual dullneſs</hi> and <hi>deadneſs</hi> in our ſelves <hi>neglected,</hi> makes way for <hi>ſecurity,</hi> and ſecurity is the high-way to ſome worſe evil. Therefore it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us to ſtrive againſt ſpiritual dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and dullneſs in <hi>the beginning,</hi> for if we neglect it, we ſhall by degrees fall into ſecurity, and when we are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure we may ſoon be ſurprized by ſome <hi>groſs</hi> and <hi>ſcandalous ſin</hi> before we are aware. <hi>Awake, O Chriſtian, rouze</hi> up thy ſelf <hi>ſtrongly</hi> when ever thou findeſt thy ſelf dull in the waies of God, awake out of thy <hi>ſecurity,</hi> for ſecurity prepares the way for ſome fall, for ſome foul fall, if thou do not ſtrive to prevent it; <hi>deadneſs</hi> brings on <hi>ſecurity,</hi> and ſecurity makes way for thy fall, ſome <hi>great fall,</hi> unleſs grace prevent.</p>
               <pb n="399" facs="tcp:64024:207"/>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> To ingage us to ſtrive againſt this <hi>deadneſs,</hi> Conſider, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <hi>deadneſs</hi> and <hi>flatneſs</hi> of ſpirit renders a mans ſtate very <hi>doubtful</hi> and <hi>ſuſpicious.</hi> It renders a mans ſtate ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doubtful whether he be in the ſtate of grace, yea or no. It was Chriſts charge againſt one of the Churches, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Thou haſt a name to live but art dead.</hi> When there is an <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual deadneſs</hi> upon the heart, when there is no life, no vigorous affections towards God, and this continues, and there is no groaning under it, no ſtriving againſt it, a man may well ſuſpect whether his ſtate be right, yea or no.</p>
               <p>Upon all theſe grounds it concerns us much to ſtrive againſt this ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al deadneſs. The <hi>Church</hi> was under deadneſs here in the Text, but ſhe did not lie down under her deadneſs; but the ſenſe ſhe had of her deadneſs and dullneſs, makes her pray, <hi>Draw me.</hi> So the ſenſe that we have of that deadneſs and dullneſs, that too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten comes upon us, ſhould make us pray much for <hi>quickening</hi> and <hi>exciting</hi> grac</p>
               <pb n="400" facs="tcp:64024:208"/>
               <p>The next Uſe is of <hi>Exhortation.</hi> This ſhould exhort us to pray much for the <hi>Drawings</hi> of divine grace. Let us take the ſame courſe that the Church here doth in the Text. Let us pray much as ſhe did, <hi>Draw me, we will run after thee.</hi> Truly, the more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance we have with our own hearts, the greater inſight we have into our ſpiritual eſtate, the more need ſhall we ſee of the conſtant quickenings and excitations of divine grace. How low and dead, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active ſhall we find our hearts to be in the waies of God, any further than we are under freſh and conſtant gales of the Spirit of God? Although we have found great quickening hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and have had our hearts very much inlarged and drawn out towards God, unleſs we have a <hi>continuation</hi> of <hi>divine grace,</hi> we ſhall ſoon find that our hearts will flagg. Holy ſouls are moſt ſenſible not only of the need of grace, but alſo of the <hi>continuation</hi> of that grace which at preſent acts them, without which they perceive their hearts would ſoon flagg and fail. The Lord promiſeth his Church, that he <hi>will
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:64024:208"/>water her every moment,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 27.3.</note> and truly we ſhall find that we need to be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered every moment. The leaſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of divine grace will ſoon make a decay in us.</p>
               <p>But here it may be ſaid, What courſe ought we to take, and what <hi>Directions</hi> may there be given in order to the obtaining of <hi>freſh gales</hi> of the Spirit, and <hi>continued</hi> ſupplies of <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace.</hi> I take this to be a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Point a little to inſiſt upon.</p>
               <p>For what ſo deſirable to holy ſouls as this, to feel <hi>frequent viſits</hi> from God in their ſouls? to be under <hi>freſh gales</hi> of the Spirit? and to have <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſupplies</hi> of grace? Therefore I ſhall ſpeak ſomething by way of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, how we may attain theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſupplies of divine grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We muſt be very <hi>thankful</hi> for grace received, <hi>To him that hath,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 25.29.</note> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abundance:</hi> the way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive more grace, is, to be exceeding thankful for grace received. Nothing provokes God to with-hold grace from us more than unthankfulneſs. <hi>But Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah rendered not according to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:64024:209"/>done unto him, therefore wrath was upon him,</hi> 2 Chron. 32.25. It is true, it was a temporal deliverance that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was unthankful for: But if unthankfulneſs for a temporal mercy, for a temporal deliverance, provoke God ſo much, what will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſs for the receipt of ſpiritual and divine grace do? The gifts of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace are the choiceſt of the gifts of God.<note place="margin">Eonum unius Gratiae eſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus Bonum Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no naturae, etiam totius univerſi. Aquinas.</note> 
                  <hi>The good of one grace is a greater good than the good of Nature, even of the whole Univerſe.</hi> So then when we are unthankful for ſo <hi>choice</hi> and <hi>excellent</hi> a gift as <hi>grace</hi> is, this provokes God much: Therefore if we would have more grace, let us be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding thankful for grace received. O make much of the influences of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace, prize them at a <hi>high rate.</hi> Believeit, you cannot command grace when you pleaſe, you cannot command the ſame <hi>quickenings, inlargements,</hi> and affections towards God (as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time you have had) when you pleaſe; therefore when God gives you any of the viſits of the Spirit, value them, and have the higheſt <hi>eſteem</hi> of them, you cannot have them when you would,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:64024:209"/>you have them not at your command, and the way to have them <hi>continued,</hi> is, to be ſenſible how great a mercy it is to enjoy them, and to be very thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you would have conſtant ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of geace, take heed of <hi>glorying</hi> and <hi>reſting</hi> in grace received: <hi>What haſt thou, that thou didſt not receive,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.7.</note> 
                  <hi>and if thou haſt received it, why doſt thou boaſt as if thou hadſt not received</hi> it? If we think we have a <hi>ſtock</hi> already in our own hands, and that we need not be beholding to God for more, this is the ready way to make God ſuſpend the influences of grace from us. It is true, it is the duty of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to <hi>ſtir</hi> up the grace of God that is in him,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.6.</note> 
                  <hi>(Stir up the gift of God that is in thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy).</hi> O but take heed that you do not reſt in <hi>grace received,</hi> as if you could act in the power of that, without new ſupplies of grace. God will keep us in conſtant dependence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we would have conſtant ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of grace, We muſt keep our <hi>eye</hi> much, and <hi>live</hi> much upon the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of grace:</hi> In <hi>Chriſt</hi> are all our
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:64024:210"/>
                  <hi>freſh Springs</hi> found, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87. laſt. <hi>All my freſh Springs are in thee. Abide in me, and I in you,</hi> ſaith our <hi>Saviour,</hi> Joh. 15.4. Happy ſoul is he that hath learnt the skill of a conſtant dependence upon <hi>Chriſt.</hi> It is a great promiſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.37. <hi>He that believeth on me, out of his belly ſhall flow ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of living waters.</hi> If we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our dependence upon Chriſt, we ſhall never want ſupplies of grace. It is likewiſe another choice and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.14. <hi>He that ſhall drink of the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt: but the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him a well of water ſpringing up into everlaſting life. He that ſhall drink of the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt:</hi> what's the meaning of that, <hi>never thirſt?</hi> ſhall he not thirſt at all? ſhall believers never thirſt? that ſeems not to be the meaning of it: But the plain meaning ſeems to be, he ſhall never <hi>thirſt,</hi> ſo as not to be <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> he ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main <hi>unſatisfied</hi> when he thirſts. And this the following words explain and make out to be the meaning, <hi>He that
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:64024:210"/>drinks of the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt,</hi> Why ſo? <hi>The water that I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him a well of water ſpringing up into everlaſting life.</hi> He that hath a well of water alwaies by him, need never thirſt, Why, ſo, ſaith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, he that lives upon me and that Fountain of grace that is in me, he need not thirſt, becauſe he hath the Fountain of grace alwaies at hand, alwaies by him, to which he may have recourſe. If we keep our eye upon the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> the <hi>fountain</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> we need never want grace, for he will be ſure to give out grace to us at all times, and upon all occaſions ſuitable to our <hi>neceſſities:</hi> It is a great Text, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.22. <hi>God hath given him to be Head over all things, to his body the Church.</hi> Chriſt is given to be a Head <hi>over all things,</hi> that is, a Head to all <hi>intents</hi> and <hi>purpoſes,</hi> to all <hi>ends</hi> and uſes whatſoever. There are no wants or neceſſities we can come under, but Chriſt is appointed for a <hi>Head</hi> to us to ſupply us in thoſe neceſſities.</p>
               <pb n="406" facs="tcp:64024:211"/>
               <p n="4">4. We muſt take heed of thoſe things that may <hi>hinder</hi> and <hi>obſtruct</hi> the <hi>influences</hi> and <hi>operations</hi> of divine grace. There are ſeveral obſtructions that do hinder the influences of grace which we ought carefully to avoid, as we would have the conſtant ſupplies of divine grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One Obſtruction that hinders the influence of divine grace, is, <hi>coldneſs</hi> and <hi>remiſneſs</hi> in our <hi>deſires</hi> after grace. <hi>God fills the hungry with good things, but the rich he ſends empty away,</hi> Luke 1.53. If we obſerve it, we ſhall find that the <hi>Promiſes</hi> run much to <hi>thirſting: If any man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 7.37. Rev. 22.17.</note> ſo, <hi>If any man thirſt, let him drink of the water of life freely.</hi> And, <hi>Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 5.6.</note> 
                  <hi>they ſhall be filled.</hi> So that we ſee the <hi>Promiſes</hi> are made much to <hi>thirſting.</hi> Now if our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>low,</hi> if we ask grace with a <hi>ſpirit of indifferency,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little concerned whether we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive grace yea or no; this is the ready way to go without grace. <hi>Ask and ye ſhall receive,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 7.7.</note> 
                  <hi>ſeek and ye ſhall
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:64024:211"/>find, knock and it ſhall be opened to you.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 81.10.</note> 
                  <hi>Open thy mouth wide and I will fill it.</hi> The more our deſires are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged after grace, the greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of grace ſhall we receive from God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another Obſtruction of divine grace, is, <hi>ſpiritual Pride.</hi> If you would have conſtant ſupplies of grace, take heed of <hi>ſpiritual Pride</hi> and <hi>ſecret liftings</hi> up of ſoul, after grace recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. If our hearts ſwell in pride, and grow big with the conceit of our own excellencies upon grace received, this is the way for God to ſuſpend and with-hold grace from us, for <hi>God reſiſts the Proud,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.5.</note> 
                  <hi>but giveth grace to the humble.</hi> Nothing is a greater ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to our graces, or our comforts than <hi>ſpiritual pride.</hi> You that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to maintain your communion with God, above all watch againſt <hi>this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi> for that will hinder your communion with God and obſtruct farther communications of grace from him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another Obſtruction of grace, is, <hi>Non-improvement</hi> of grace recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>not complying</hi> with thoſe moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:64024:212"/>of the Spirit of God we have already had. If we have had the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit of God provoking us, and putting us forward to what is <hi>good,</hi> checking us and warning us againſt what is <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>ſinful,</hi> and we do not comply with theſe moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, how can we expect farther aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from the Spirit of God? The Spirit of God is moſt free and liberal in the communication of his grace, where it is kindly dealt with, where his motions are obeyed and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But if we do not make uſe of what grace we have already recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Spirit of God, how can we expect farther Grace from him?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another Obſtruction of <hi>divine grace,</hi> is, <hi>Guilt lying upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi> Whileſt any ſin lyes <hi>unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,</hi> &amp;c. whileſt there is any <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of <hi>difference</hi> between God and us, this may cauſe God to ſuſpend divine grace.</p>
               <p>This is certain, That <hi>David</hi> by his <hi>fall</hi> had loſt that <hi>preſence</hi> and <hi>famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity</hi> of the Spirit of God with him, which he had before his <hi>fall;</hi> and
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:64024:212"/>therefore he prayes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.11. <hi>Take not thy holy Spirit from me.</hi> The Spirit of God was ſo far depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him, that he was afraid of loſing the Spirit of God quite and clean, ſo in the twelfth <hi>Verſe, Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold me with thy free Spirit.</hi> He did not feel that <hi>power</hi> and <hi>preſence,</hi> and <hi>energy</hi> of the Spirit of God in his heart, as he was wont to do. If the Spirit of God have taken any offence and diſtaſt at us, by reaſon of any miſcarriage of ours, that offence muſt be removed, and the Spirit of God treated very kindly before he will return again. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39. laſt <hi>Verſe,</hi> the Lord promiſeth there that he will <hi>no more hide his face from the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> for he had <hi>poured</hi> out his <hi>Spirit</hi> upon them. <hi>Neither will I hide my face any more from them, for I have poured out my Spirit upon the houſe of Iſrael, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> Obſerve it, Gods <hi>pouring out of his Spirit,</hi> is a ſign that he is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled</hi> to us, it is a ſign of <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,</hi> and we cannot expect that God ſhould pour out his Spirit upon us, ſo as that we ſhould find that
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:64024:213"/>free and familiar operation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God in our hearts, till all things be clear between God and us; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the guilt of any ſin lying on the conſcience <hi>unpardoned,</hi> may obſtruct the communications of <hi>Divine Grace,</hi> and may hinder that <hi>intimate, fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar preſence</hi> of the Spirit of God which ſometimes we have had.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another Obſtruction of divine grace, is, ſome corruption or ſin <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged</hi> and continued in. The Saints are ſaid to be an <hi>habitation of God by the Spirit.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 2.22.</note> Now the Spirit of God loves a <hi>pure and chaſt habitation.</hi> If we <hi>ſully</hi> and <hi>defile</hi> our ſouls by the <hi>love</hi> of any ſin, by <hi>indulging</hi> our ſelves in any corruption, we render our hearts a very <hi>unfit habitation</hi> for that pure and holy Spirit to dwell in. <hi>Know you not,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that your bodyes are the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt which dwelleth in you,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.19. Our <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Bodies</hi> are the <hi>Temple</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, and certainly if we defile this Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, we cannot expect that the Spirit of God will make his reſidence in it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Turn
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:64024:213"/>you at my reproof, behold I will pour out my Spirit upon you.</hi> If the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God rebuke us for any ſin, we ought preſently to take this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke; If the Spirit of God give us a ſecret hint and intimation that ſuch a thing is <hi>amiſs,</hi> we ought to reform that thing, we ought to take ſuch a hint, and what then? then God <hi>will pour out his Spirit upon us.</hi> But if we retain the love of ſin, and perſiſt, and go on in ſin, after God hath rebuked and check'd us for it, we cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that God will pour out his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon us: For the <hi>Promiſe runs, Turn ye at my reproof, and I will pour out my Spirit upon you;</hi> not otherwiſe: ſo that if we retain the love of ſin, after God hath check'd and rebuked us for it, we cannot expect the communication of divine grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The laſt impediment of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace that I ſhall mention, is, <hi>ſecurity</hi> and <hi>preſumption</hi> of our own ſtrength and ſufficiency. If we think we have a ſtock in our own hand, and have quickening and inlargement at command, and can act at our own
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:64024:214"/>pleaſure in the waies of God without Divine Aſſiſtance, nothing provokes God ſooner to withdraw his grace from us.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the <hi>impediments</hi> and <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions</hi> of divine grace. Now if we would have conſtant ſupplies of grace, we muſt take heed of all thoſe things that obſtruct the <hi>paſſage</hi> of grace, and do hinder the communication of it to our ſouls.</p>

                  <hi>Love</hi> is the <hi>foot</hi> of the ſoul.

Thus we read how <hi>Eliſha</hi> run after <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.20. <hi>He left the Oxen and run after Elijah,</hi> that is, his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections were now up and he muſt needs follow <hi>Elijah.</hi> So that running notes the <hi>elevation</hi> of the affections: when the affections that were <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>lumpiſh</hi> before, begin to <hi>move</hi> and <hi>ſpring</hi> afreſh towards God, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Or ever I was aware, my ſoul made me like the Chariots of Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadab.</hi> Many make theſe to be the

Her ſoul</hi> made her as the <hi>Chariots of Aminadab,</hi> that is, her affections did move ſwiftly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chriſt. <hi>Draw me, we will run after thee. Running</hi> here in the <hi>Text</hi> is oppoſed to <hi>deadneſs,</hi> the Church found her affections flat and dead before, therefore ſhe prays to be drawn by divine grace. Now when ſhe is drawn, ſhe ſaith, ſhe <hi>will run,</hi> that is, ſhe ſhall have <hi>new af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</hi> Her affections that were dead and flat before, ſhall now be quick and lively towards God and Chriſt.</p>

               <p>The ſecond thing to be ſpoken to, is this, How it is that the Saints have their hearts <hi>carryed out after God.</hi> The end why they deſire di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace, is, That they may <hi>run</hi> in a <hi>ſpiritual manner,</hi> and that their hearts may be carryed after God. Now how is it that the Saints have their hearts carryed out after God?</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Saints have their hearts carryed out after God <hi>by deſires and longings after him,</hi> Pſal. 63.1. <hi>My ſoul thirſteth after thee, my fleſh long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for thee,</hi> Iſa. 26.8, 9. <hi>The deſire of our ſoul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee;</hi> and in the next Verſe, <hi>With my ſoul have I deſired thee in the night, yea with my ſpirit within me will I ſeek thee early.</hi> Whileſt other men do <hi>mainly</hi> and <hi>principally</hi> thirſt and cover after the
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:64024:217"/>
                  <hi>creature,</hi> holy ſouls do <hi>mainly</hi> and <hi>principally</hi> thirſt after God himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1. <hi>As the Hart panteth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the water brooks, ſo panteth my ſoul after thee, O God.</hi> The <hi>Hart</hi> is a <hi>thirſty creature</hi> by nature, and when it is hunted its thirſt is greater, ſuch is the thirſt of holy ſouls after God.</p>
               <p>But it may be ſaid, What is that <hi>thirſt</hi> that holy ſouls have after God?</p>
               <p>It lies <hi>eminently</hi> in <hi>two things,</hi> and it will be good for us to obſerve them, becauſe we may know much what the meaſure of our grace is by theſe two things; Holy ſouls thirſt after Gods <hi>gracious preſence</hi> here on earth; and they thirſt after <hi>Gods glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Holy ſouls thirſt after <hi>Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preſence</hi> here on earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.2. <hi>My ſoul thirſteth for God, for the living God; when ſhall I come and appear before God? When ſhall I come and appear before God?</hi> that is, when ſhall I ſee the <hi>face</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>Ordinances,</hi> Pſal. 101.2. <hi>When wilt thou come unto me?</hi> Nothing more proper to grace than this, to
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:64024:218"/>carry out the ſoul in longings after communion with <hi>God.</hi> If you feel nothing of this in your ſelves, if you do not find <hi>ardent, ſtrong breathings</hi> and longings in your ſouls after <hi>God,</hi> you have reaſon to ſuſpect your ſelves that all is not well with you. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the ſoul be under <hi>Temptation,</hi> or under the <hi>prevalency</hi> of ſome cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption at the preſent, or under the withdrawings of the influences of the Spirit of <hi>God</hi> in ſome time of <hi>Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> I ſay, unleſs it be in ſuch caſes as theſe, the <hi>pulſe</hi> of the ſoul will beat this way, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>ardent brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things</hi> after <hi>God</hi> and communion with him; and if we do not find it to be thus with us, we have reaſon to fear the ſtate of our own ſouls, for thus it will be if grace act like it ſelf in our hearts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Saints have great longings after the <hi>ſight</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in Heaven. <hi>Come, come, is the language</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in general, <hi>The Spirit and the Bride ſay, come,</hi> Revel. 22.17. <hi>Being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident and willing rather to be abſent from the body, and to be preſent with
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:64024:218"/>the Lord. Come, Lord Jeſus, come quickly,</hi> is the language of particular Saints. Certainly the <hi>pulſe</hi> of grace, if I may ſo expreſs it, beats mainly theſe two waies: In longing after a ſenſe of <hi>Gods</hi> preſence in our ſouls here on earth; and in longing after the perfect injoyment of <hi>God</hi> in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Saints have their hearts carryed out to <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Love. Love</hi> is the <hi>motion</hi> of the ſoul to the thing <hi>beloved.</hi> The ſoul naturally moves towards that it loves. Love is the <hi>weight</hi> or <hi>ballance</hi> of the <hi>ſoul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amor meus eſt pondus meum, eò feror, quò amo.</note> the <hi>ſoul is carryed where it</hi> loves. Now the ſouls of the Saints are carryed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>God</hi> by Love,<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.25.</note> 
                  <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi> And, <hi>I will love thee, O Lord, my ſtrength,</hi> Pſal. 18.1. <hi>God</hi> himſelf is the <hi>great thing</hi> in the eye of holy ſouls; though <hi>friends</hi> be dear, <hi>relations dear,</hi> yet <hi>God</hi> himſelf is <hi>moſt dear.</hi> O <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin,</hi> thou art not only dearer to me than this earth, and <hi>all things that are in it, but thou art more acceptable to me than Heaven it ſelf, and all the things that are in it.</hi> Hence is that
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:64024:219"/>of <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43.4. <hi>I will go to God my exceeding joy.</hi> The joy of my joy,<note place="margin">Laetitia <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>etitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> that is, the top of my joy. Though other things may be amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a godly man in their place, yet <hi>God</hi> himſelf is moſt amiable to an holy ſoul.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Saints have their hearts carryed out to <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Admiration;</hi> that which we call <hi>admiration,</hi> is, the <hi>fixing</hi> or <hi>ſtaying</hi> of the mind up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome <hi>excellent object;</hi> the minds <hi>fixing</hi> or <hi>ſtaying</hi> it ſelf <hi>with delight</hi> upon ſome object which it is pleaſed with. Admiration takes in a double <hi>act</hi> of the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It takes in an act of the <hi>mind</hi> or <hi>underſtanding;</hi> what we admire the mind <hi>fixeth</hi> and <hi>dwells</hi> upon; <hi>admiration detains</hi> and <hi>holds</hi> the mind <hi>fixt</hi> in the <hi>contemplation</hi> of a thing; what we admire the mind doth not preſently go off from, but it ſtaies and dwells upon it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Admiration</hi> takes in the act of the <hi>will;</hi> the will likes and is well pleaſed with the goodneſs of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and that makes the mind fix and ſtay upon it.</p>
               <pb n="423" facs="tcp:64024:219"/>
               <p>Thus the ſouls of the Saints are carryed out to <hi>God</hi> by admiration; Holy ſouls love the <hi>divine excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> and they are pleaſed in it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the will cauſeth the mind or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to fix it ſelf in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of it. <hi>My meditation of him ſhall be ſweet,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 104.34.</note> The Saints cannot alwaies get up their hearts to this frame of admiration, and it is matter of bitter complaint to holy ſouls, that they cannot find their hearts ſo taken with the <hi>divine perfections,</hi> as ſometimes they have been; but this is certain, this is moſt pleaſing to a holy ſoul when he finds his heart moſt taken and raviſhed with the excellencies of God, and when he can admire him more than all created things.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Saints have their hearts carryed out to God by <hi>delight.</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light carries the heart powerfully to the object we delight in, what we delight in we cannot but think of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.47. <hi>I will delight my ſelf in thy Commandments, which I have loved:</hi> As much as if he ſhould have ſaid, the love and affection which I
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:64024:220"/>have to thy Commandments carries out my heart to them. Thus the Saints do ſometimes find their hearts carryed out to delight in God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.14. <hi>Then ſhalt thou delight thy ſelf in the Lord.</hi> It is true, it is too ſeldom, too <hi>rare,</hi> that we can thus delight our ſelves in God, there is one thing or other that interpoſeth to hinder us from delighting in God; ſometimes <hi>guilt</hi> interpoſeth, that <hi>clogs</hi> our conſciences, and that hinders us from delighting in God. Sometimes inordinate affection to the creature ſteps in, and when our affections are diverted and turned into another chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, we cannot ſo delight in God as we ought to do. Sometimes <hi>ſpiritual darkneſs</hi> and <hi>deadneſs</hi> hinders our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Spiritual darkneſs</hi> hinders us from delighting in God, we have loſt that <hi>ſight</hi> of God, we have loſt thoſe <hi>apprehenſions</hi> of God, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we have had; and if we have loſt that <hi>ſight of God,</hi> and thoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of God that once we had, no wonder we cannot delight in him, for our affections follow our
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:64024:220"/>apprehenſions, as we have heard.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Spiritual deadneſs</hi> hinders us. Our affections are flat and low, and we cannot get them up to God, ſo (that as was ſaid) it is too ſeldom that we get our hearts into this frame to delight in God; but it is happy with the Saints when they can find it thus with them, it is never ſo well with them, as when they can have their hearts carryed out with delight to God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Saints have their hearts carryed out to God by <hi>adherence.</hi> When we can find our hearts inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately and firmly adhering to God, then are our hearts carryed out to him. <hi>It is good for me to draw near to God,</hi> Pſal. 73.28. It is good for me to <hi>adhere to God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bonum eſt mihi adhaere Deo.</note> ſo the words are rendred by learned men; ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.8. <hi>My ſoul followeth hard after thee.</hi> This <hi>following hard after God,</hi> implies two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Strong deſires after God. And</p>
               <p n="2">2. Intimate adhering or cleaving of the ſoul to God,<note place="margin">Adhaeret anima mea poſt te, hoc eſt, vitae ſecurus acquieſco.</note>

               <p n="6">6. And laſtly, The Saints have their hearts carryed forth towards God in a way of <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> Pſal. 63.5. <hi>My ſoul ſhall be ſatisfied as with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and fatneſs.</hi> He is ſpeaking of <hi>communion</hi> with God: If he can have but communion with God, oh then his ſoul ſhall be ſatisfied as with <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> and <hi>fatneſs.</hi> Nothing can <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> the deſires of the ſoul but an <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite good.</hi> When the ſoul hath taken

                  </note> It is the ſaying of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin, Lord, do thou quicken, and ſtir up our hearts, do thou call hack our hearts to thy ſelf, do thou inflame them, do thou raviſh them and allure them, do thou ſet them on fire, do thou ſweeten and indear thy ſelf to us. Now, now let us run and love.</hi> Truly till divine grace doth <hi>excite, inflame, allure,</hi> and <hi>ſet our hearts on fire,</hi> we ſhall find we cannot run after Chriſt. How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten do we find a great <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty clog</hi> lying on our ſouls, that we cannot <hi>aſcend</hi> to God as we would? We ſhould pray therefore that <hi>God</hi> would remove this <hi>weight,</hi> that he would quicken our hearts by the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Spirit. O when our ſouls are carryed forth with life and vigour towards <hi>God,</hi> then ſhall we find reſt and ſweetneſs, and peace to our ſouls. On the contrary, when our hearts are <hi>eſtranged</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> when our affections
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:64024:223"/>are flat and dead towards him, we ſhall find nothing but trouble and diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>reſtleſneſs</hi> and <hi>diſſatisfaction</hi> in our ſouls. <hi>Return to thy reſt,</hi>

                  <hi>O my ſoul,</hi> ſaith that <hi>holy man. God</hi> alone is the <hi>reſt</hi> of ſouls; ſo far as our hearts are carryed out with <hi>life</hi> and <hi>vigour</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>God,</hi> we ſhall find <hi>reſt, peace,</hi> and <hi>quiet</hi> to our ſoul; ſo far as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from him, we ſhall find nothing but trouble and diſquietment: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us pray with the Chruch here, <hi>Draw me, we will run after thee.</hi>
